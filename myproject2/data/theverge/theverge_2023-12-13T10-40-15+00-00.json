climate-vulnerable countries and environmental advocates scored some key wins with clean energy after heated climate negotiations wrapped up in the united arab emirates, a top oil- and gas-producing country. this was the closest yet that countries have gotten to striking a global deal to phase out the use of coal, oil, and gas. but the summit was arguably still a home game for fossil fuel interests who threw their weight around the , where tens of thousands of delegates and activists from nearly every nation on earth have gathered over the past two weeks to wrangle over the future of fossil fuels. now that the dust has settled, these are some of the biggest decisions made in dubai that could determine how we power our world in the future. \u201cthis text is a step forward on our path towards phasing out fossil fuels, but is not the historic decision we hoped for.\u201d came to the table pushing for an official agreement to \u201cphase out fossil fuels.\u201d doing so would address a glaring omission in the 2015 paris accord, which never actually mentions coal, oil, or natural gas despite being an international agreement to stop global warming. alas, countries still aren\u2019t facing the root of the problem. bringing the deal to the finish line required nearly 200 countries to agree on the same language. ultimately, draft language explicitly calling for the phaseout of fossil fuels was stricken from the final text of agreements brokered at this year\u2019s climate talks. what the world got instead is a weaker call for \u201ctransitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade.\u201d a landmark united nations-backed in 2018 found that countries need to cut their\u00a0emissions\u00a0nearly in half by 2030 to meet goals set in the paris climate accord. the final text also calls on countries to work toward \u201caccelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power.\u201d to be clear, every word in that phrase is pretty dirty. coal of course is the most polluting fossil fuel, one reason why it\u2019s hard to ignore in a climate agreement. but a commitment to phase its use is decidedly weaker than one to phase it out. it mirrors language in a recent addressed to participating governments from cop28 president sultan ahmed al jaber \u2014 who also happens to be the ceo of the abu dhabi national oil company. the un\u2019s decision to hold the summit in the united arab emirates, a major oil and gas producer, wound up giving the fossil fuel industry unprecedented access. there were more fossil fuel lobbyists in dubai than at any climate conference in the 28 years the united nations has convened it. industry from every country present at the talks except the united arab emirates and brazil. al jaber even used his position as cop28 president to lobby for oil and gas deals with other governments, according to an by the bbc and the centre for climate reporting. even so, there were hopeful signs last week when documents coming out of the conference included options to incorporate language that called on countries to phase out fossil fuel use (there was also an option not to include such a clause). then the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) to its member states pressuring them to \u201cproactively reject any text or formula that targets energy i.e. fossil fuels rather than emissions.\u201d following the letter, language that had previously called on countries to phase out fossil fuels vanished from subsequent draft texts. backlash was swift. \u201cthis obsequious draft reads as if opec dictated it word for word,\u201d former us vice president on monday. \u201ccop28 is now on the verge of complete failure.\u201d that brings us back to the language coming out of cop28 to phase down coal. using the word \u201cunabated\u201d \u2014 whether for coal, oil, or gas \u2014 carves out a huge loophole for fossil fuels. it means that polluters can continue burning fossil fuels as long as they pair it with that capture greenhouse gas emissions (though typically not 100 percent of those emissions) that are still unproven at scale. \u201cthis text is a step forward on our path towards phasing out fossil fuels, but is not the historic decision we hoped for ... given the overwhelming momentum among countries in support of a renewable energy package and a long overdue fossil fuel phase out, we needed a far more ambitious result.\u201d andreas sieber, associate director of policy and campaigns for environmental group , said in a statement before the draft agreement was finalized at the conference\u2019s closing plenary. even though the lack of a clear plan to phase out fossil fuels is a blow to climate action, this isn\u2019t exactly a zero sum game. solar and wind power are already to coal, oil, and gas in most of the world when it comes to meeting new electricity demand. nearly all of the world\u2019s electricity supply over the next few years is expected to come from renewable and nuclear energy, . the agency, which was initially founded to safeguard the world\u2019s fuel supply after the 1970s oil crisis, called a global transition to clean energy earlier this year and forecast that demand for coal, oil, and gas would peak this decade. when it comes down to it, getting cleaner sources of\u00a0energy\u00a0online looks inevitable at this point. there were some notable new commitments on the clean energy front in the final texts coming out of cop28, too. it calls for the tripling of renewable energy capacity globally by 2030, something that more than 100 countries had already pledged to do while negotiations were taking place last week. leading up to the conference, the world\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas polluters \u2014 the us and china \u2014 when each country\u2019s climate envoys met in california in november. there\u2019s a lot of underpinning these kinds of negotiations. the world, on average, is about than it was before the industrial revolution. that might not sound like much, but it\u2019s enough to drive more devastating hurricane and wildfire seasons, and suck drought-vulnerable places dry while displacing other communities faced with rising tides. the mountain of climate research we have today describes much higher risks for life on earth if warming reaches two degrees. we\u2019re talking about the . twice as many of the world\u2019s megacities , exposing some 350 million people to dangerously high temperatures by 2050, that . the longer the world runs on fossil fuels, the bigger those risks grow. it\u2019s why the paris agreement commits countries to working together to avoid two degrees of warming, ideally stopping temperatures from rising above 1.5 degrees celsius. staying below that lower threshold requires slashing greenhouse gas emissions down to net zero as soon as possible. and you can\u2019t get rid of all those greenhouse gas emissions without also saying goodbye to fossil fuels. / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"},

(this would turn out to be .) or when i was whisked away to a secret room at an ubisoft event to and hear michel ancel emphasize, \u201cwe now really believe that we\u2019re going to make this game.\u201d (ancel has since retired from game development and, six years later, the sequel has yet to be released.) then, there was the time when i asked masahiro sakurai, , what kind of reaction he got after telling the development team how big of a game  would be. at first, he didn\u2019t have a response for me at all\u2026 but then a fellow developer who happened to be in the room chimed in to say that he remembered everyone getting very quiet. finally, sakurai chimed in with an excellent line: \u201cfrom where i stood, all i heard was dead silence.\u201d it made the piece i was writing. it\u2019s not like these moments could never happen without e3. there are still in-person events like gdc, and the industry has become pretty accustomed to virtual interviews. but there\u2019s something to say for not just the scale but the concentration of e3 \u2014 a week or so where you don\u2019t have time to do anything but think and talk about games. i won\u2019t miss how tired it made me, but i\u2019ll certainly miss the stories. / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"},
