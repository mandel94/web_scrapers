(it doesn\u2019t even need you to log in.) it is, he says, just connecting to apple\u2019s servers like an iphone would. migicovsky knows that security will be the big question on potential users\u2019 minds. to address concerns, migicovsky says beeper\u2019s imessage code will be open source for others to review. beeper\u2019s cto, brad murray, also spent some time trying to break open the system as if he were an attacker and is publishing his findings. the bigger question may be how long beeper mini can survive. migicovsky believes he\u2019s on the right side of the law (he points to a copyright carveout for reverse engineering and says there\u2019s no apple code in beeper mini); and he believes it\u2019d be too difficult for apple to cut beeper off without also breaking imessage for legions of genuine apple devices. i\u2019m not so sure on either count \u2014\u00a0apple is deeply protective of imessage for the iphone, and it\u2019s hard to imagine the company ignoring the spate of third-party imessage solutions forever. at the very least, beeper has been operating the less secure kind of imessage relay for nearly three years, and migicovsky says he hasn\u2019t heard a word from apple yet. apple didn\u2019t respond to \u2019s request for comment about third-party imessage apps. beeper initially launched in 2021, promising to build a singular home for all your messaging. the company has raised $16 million in pursuit of that goal and grown in size to about 20 people. the 16-year-old developer who reverse engineered imessage is now working for beeper as a contractor; migicovsky declined to share further details about the student, citing privacy concerns. a github page belonging to the student says he lives in pennsylvania. beeper mini lands at a strange moment for both beeper and imessage: apple recently said it would adopt , bringing many of the key benefits of imessage \u2014 good quality photos, read receipts, and eventually encryption \u2014 to cross-platform texting. once those features arrive, beeper will largely just be offering you that coveted blue bubble. most people didn\u2019t notice the bubbles had turned blue in my experience, most people i messaged simply didn\u2019t notice. the group thread moved on. photos came through. messages were just a different color. of course, that\u2019s the whole thing with the blue / green bubble divide: it\u2019s largely artificial. it\u2019s often not about the ability to have a chat, just to identify the odd person out. that didn\u2019t matter much for me, but i suspect it will for many others \u2014 and for those who feel punished by their green bubbles, maybe beeper mini will be worth using. at launch, the service will cost $2 per month and only offer access to imessage. migicovsky says beeper mini will eventually drop the \u201cmini\u201d branding and integrate all the other chat services offered on beeper\u2019s main app \u2014 whatsapp, messenger, signal, and so on, all hacked together to work inside a single convenient interface. my biggest complaint at the moment is that beeper mini doesn\u2019t support sms and rcs, so this one-day all-in-one app is currently dividing my texting experience in two. migicovsky says bundling in sms and rcs is coming, too. all those extra services might just cost a little more, though. even with rcs coming to imessage, migicovsky thinks there\u2019s still an important role for beeper. \u201cthe long-term vision is one app that you can use to chat with anyone in the world,\u201d he says. it\u2019s a great goal \u2014\u00a0beeper just has its work cut out to keep them all tied together. / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"},

yeah, so we have our annual coming up, where we basically invite our network of members and users to come, and we talk about some of the really exciting news. what we\u2019re announcing this year is actually we have a really exciting upgraded quantum processor that we\u2019re talking about. it\u2019s called the ibm quantum heron. it has 133 qubits. it\u2019s the highest performance processor that we\u2019ve ever built, and it\u2019s going to be available for users to access via our cloud services. we\u2019re also launching ibm quantum system two and introducing this as a new architecture for scaling our quantum computers into the future. we\u2019re also talking about a 10-year roadmap looking ahead. we, at ibm quantum, like to sort of call our shots, tell everyone what we\u2019re doing because that keeps us honest, keeps everyone in the industry on the same benchmark of seeing what progress is. and we\u2019re expanding that roadmap, which we actually first introduced a couple of years ago and have hit all our milestones thus far. but we are extending it out to 2033, pushing forward into this next realm where we\u00a0 really want to drive toward pushing quantum computing at scale. we\u2019re not even at the point of solving real problems. not yet. but we are, really excitingly, just this past year, at the point where we\u2019re calling this utility-scale quantum computing. we\u2019re using 100-plus qubits. we used a processor earlier in the year called eagle, where we were able to look at a particular problem that you couldn\u2019t really solve with brute-force methods using a classical computer, but also it challenged the best classical approximation methods that are used on high-performance computing. so what\u2019s interesting there is that now the quantum computer becomes like the benchmark. you almost need it to verify whether your approximate classical methods are working properly. and that just happens when you go over 100 qubits. at 100 qubits, things all change so that you just can\u2019t use, say, gpus or any kind of classical computers to simulate what\u2019s going on accurately. this is why we\u2019re in this phase where we call it utility scale because there\u2019s going to be this back and forth between using a quantum as a tool compared with what you can still potentially do in classical. but then there\u2019s a long road there that we\u2019re going to try to drive value using the quantum to get toward quantum manage. that\u2019s right. we see this really as an inflection point. there are a lot of industries that use high-performance computation already, and they are looking at very, very hard problems that use the oak ridge supercomputers and whatnot. and now quantum becomes an additional tool that opens up a new lens for them to look at a different area of compute space that they weren\u2019t able to look at before. i\u2019d say that it\u2019s a very exciting time to be in this field. how often do you get to say you\u2019re building from the ground floor of a completely new computational architecture? something that is just fundamentally different from traditional classical computing. and so yeah, i\u2019d say that there\u2019s certainly a lot of groundswell, there\u2019s a lot of buzz. sometimes a little too much buzz, maybe. but also i think from the perspective of competition, it helps drive the industry forward. we, at ibm, have been at the forefront of computation for decades. and so it\u2019s in our blood. the ideas of roadmaps and pushing the next big development, the next big innovations in computation, have always been something that is just native to ibm, and quantum is no different. we\u2019ve been in the game with quantum since the early for probably 30 years, 30-plus years. but now we\u2019re really starting to bear a lot of that fruit in terms of building the architectures, building the systems, putting out the hardware, developing the framework for how to make it usable and accessible. certainly not at that scale. there\u2019s certainly a growing quantum community. \u201cat 100 qubits, things all change\u201d there are people that are interested across the board, from developers, to students, to fortune 500 companies. we have a lot of interest. so just as an example, we systems on the cloud in 2016. we put a very simple five-qubit computer, five-qubit quantum computer, on the cloud. but it reflected a real fundamental shift in how quantum could be approached. before, you had to be sort of a physicist. you had to be in a laboratory turning knobs. you\u2019re taking data, you\u2019re running physicist code; you\u2019re not programming a computer. well, i\u2019m a physicist, and you don\u2019t want to see my code. [ ] but the whole point is that we developed a whole framework around it to actually deploy it and to make it programmable. and think about the early days of computers and all the infrastructure you needed to build in terms of the right assembly language and compilers and the application layers all above that. we\u2019ve been building that for the last seven years since that first launched. and in that time, we\u2019ve had over 500,000 users of our platform and of our services. i would say that we\u2019re knocking on the door of business value and looking for that business value, because especially when we\u2019re in this realm where we know that it can be used as a tool pitted against the best classical computers, there\u2019s something there to be explored. a lot of times, even with traditional computers, there are very few proven algorithms that are where we drive all the value. a lot of the value that gets driven is done through heuristics, through just trial and error, through having the tool and using it on a particular problem. that\u2019s why we see this fundamental game-changer of this inflection point going toward utility scale systems of over 100 qubits as now this is the tool that we want users to actually go and find business advantage, find the problems that map appropriately onto these systems for exploration. yes, absolutely. so we\u2019re ibm quantum within ibm research. ibm research has always been the organic growth engine for all of ibm. it\u2019s where a lot of the innovative ideas come in, but overall, a particular strategy within ibm and ibm research is that we\u2019re not just doing research and then we\u2019re going to do development and then it\u2019s going to go on this very linearized product journey. it\u2019s all integrated together as we are moving forward. and so therefore, we have the opportunity within ibm quantum that we\u2019re developing products, we\u2019re putting it on the cloud, we\u2019re integrating with ibm cloud. we\u2019re actually pushing these things forward to build that user base, build that groundswell, before all the various different technology elements are finished. that\u2019s sort of this agile methodology of building this from the ground up, but also getting it out early and often to drive excitement and to really build up the other parts of the ecosystem. so we don\u2019t speak explicit numbers, but we have several hundred people. and then we have parts of the team which are focused on the actual hardware elements, all the way down to the actual quantum processor and the system around it in terms of making those processors function by cooling it down in the cryogenic system, talking to it with control electronics, talking to it with classical computing. so it all needs to tie together. then you have software development teams. we also have a cloud and services team that helps to deliver our offerings as a service. and then we have applications teams looking at the next algorithms, the next novel ways of making use of our quantum services. we also have teams that are more outward-looking for business development \u2014 trying to drive adoption, working with various clients to engage in the problems of their interests. we also have a part of our team which runs an offering called the quantum accelerator. it\u2019s like a consulting arm, working with the clients to get quantum-ready, start understanding how their problems can be impacted by quantum computing and start using our systems. no, so all those different ones report to our vice president of quantum computing, which is jay gambetta. i take care of the systems part. basically, the wrapping of the processor and how it runs, executing problems for the users, that\u2019s the piece that i own. oh, yeah. we have a very good strategy across the team. we know our core services and what the core product we have is. and also we have a roadmap. the concept of the roadmap is both great for the r&d side but also great for the client perspective, business development angle view of seeing what\u2019s coming next. from the internal side, we know we\u2019ve got to continue to drive toward this, and these are our deliverables and these are the new innovations that we need to do. in fact, in our new roadmap that we\u2019re releasing, we have that separated. both a development roadmap, which is more product focused and more like what the end user\u2019s going to get and client\u2019s going to get. and we have an innovation roadmap to show those things which we\u2019re still going to need to turn to crank and figure out what feeds in. i often say the roadmap is our mantra, and it really is our calling card both internally and externally. not many people really show a lot of detail in their roadmap, but it serves as a guiding tool for us all. we have a transition toward what we are calling quantum at scale, which i think what you\u2019re referring to is when you will get to the point where you can run quantum error correction, correct for all the errors that are underlying within these qubits, which are noisy. people throw around that number \u2014 millions of qubits \u2014 in a way that almost drives fear into the hearts of people. one actually really exciting thing that we\u2019ve done this past year is we\u2019ve developed a set of novel error correction codes that brings down that resource count a lot. so actually, you\u2019ll need potentially hundreds of thousands of qubits, 100,000 qubits or so, to build a fault-tolerant quantum error-correction-based quantum computer of a particular size to do some of those problems that we\u2019re talking about at scale. and that\u2019s part of the roadmap, too. so that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at further to the blue jay system in 2033. so there\u2019s certainly a number of birds to get there, but we have concrete ideas for the technological hurdles to overcome to get there. our roadmap is showing that type of progression. even where we are today with heron, and actually complementary to heron this year, we also already built a 1,000-qubit processor, condor. its explicit goal was to push the limits of how many qubits could we put on a single chip, push the limits of how much architecture could we put in an entire system. how much could we actually cool down in the dilution refrigerators that we know today, the cryogenic refrigerators that we have today? push the boundaries of everything to understand where things break. and if you look at the early part of our roadmap, the birds are there with various technological hurdles that we\u2019ve already overcome to get toward this thousand-qubit level. and now those next birds that you see in the rest of the innovation roadmap are different types of couplers, different types of technologies, that are those technological hurdles, like in semiconductors, that allow us to bridge the gap. \u201ci\u2019d say, the decades of experience matter\u201d they\u2019re different, because with this sort of modular approach, there\u2019s some that are like, how many can we place into a single chip? how many can we place into a single package? how many can we package together within the system? so they all require slightly different technological innovations within the whole value chain. but we don\u2019t see them as not doable; we see them certainly as things that we will handle over the next few years. we\u2019re already starting to test linking between two packages via a cryogenic cable. this is toward our flamingo demonstration, which we\u2019re planning for next year. oh, yeah. not so explicitly to the newest stuff that\u2019s happening today in semiconductors. but ibm has been in the semiconductors game for many, many decades. and a lot of the work that we\u2019ve achieved with even achieving a 100 qubits with eagle a couple of years ago was because we had that deep-rooted semiconductor background. so just to give you an example, at 100 qubits, the challenge is how do you actually wire to 100 qubits in a chip? the standard thing you do in semiconductors is you go to more layers, but it\u2019s not so easy to do that just in these superconducting quantum circuits because they might mess up the qubits. it might cause them to decohere. but because of our know-how with packaging, we found the right materials, we found the right way of using our fabrication techniques to implement that type of multilayer wiring and still talk to these 100 qubits. we evolved that further this past year to actually get to 1,000. and so that type of semiconductor know-how is just ingrained and something that is, i\u2019d say, the decades of experience matter. okay. well, to build the next-generation quantum computing chip, we rely on advanced packaging techniques that involve multiple layers of superconducting metal to package and to wire up various superconducting qubits. with heron, we\u2019re also using a novel tunable coupler architecture, which allows us to have world-record performing two-qubit gate qualities. and all this is done in a standard fabrication facility that we have at ibm and package up this chip, and we have to cool it down into a cryogenic environment. i mean, certainly more steps than that. [ ] and there\u2019s this know-how of how to do it properly to have high-performing qubits, which we\u2019ve just built up. yeah, so the tricky thing with these qubits\u2026 there are different ways of building qubits. there are people who use ions and atoms and electrons and things like that, but ours are actually just metal on a substrate; they\u2019re circuits. they\u2019re much like the circuits that you might see when you look inside of a standard chip. but the problem with these circuits is that you can build, so you can basically arrange them in a certain way and use the right materials. and you have a qubit that, in this case, for superconducting qubits, it resonates at five gigahertz. if you choose the wrong materials, the lifetimes of these qubits can be extremely short. so when we first started in the field of building superconducting qubits in 1999, superconducting qubits lasted for maybe like two nanoseconds, five nanoseconds. today, we\u2019ve gotten up to close to a millisecond, hundreds of microseconds to a millisecond. already in numbers orders of magnitude longer. but that took many years of development. and at the point of a few hundred microseconds, we\u2019re able to do all these complex operations that we\u2019ve been talking about to push this utility scale that we discussed earlier. so that know-how to increase that lifetime comes down to engineering, comes down to understanding the core pieces that generate loss in the materials, and that\u2019s something that we certainly have expertise at. when we think about competitors, you can think about the platform competitors of who\u2019s building the services, but i think what you\u2019re pointing to more is the hardware side. when it comes down to it, there\u2019s a simple set of metrics for you to compare the performance of the quantum processors. it\u2019s scale: what number of qubits can you get to and build reliably? quality: how long do those qubits live for you to perform operations and calculations on? and speed: how quickly can you actually run executions and problems through these quantum processors? and that speed part is something where it\u2019s an interplay between your quantum processor and your classical computing infrastructure because they talk to one another. you don\u2019t control a quantum computer without a classical computer. and so you need to be able to get your data in, data out and process it on the classical side. so scale, quality, speed. our approach with superconducting qubits, to the best of our knowledge, we can hit all three of those in a very strong way. scale, pushed up to over 1,000 qubits. we know that we can build up to 1,000 qubits already with the technologies that we\u2019ve built. from the quality, heron \u2014 which we\u2019re releasing \u2014 has the best gate quality. so the gates, the operations, the gate qualities that have been shown across a large device. and then speed, in terms of just the execution times, we\u2019re on the order of microseconds for some of the clock rates, whereas other approaches can be a thousand orders of magnitude slower. so there are trapped ions: basically they\u2019re using molecular ions like caesium and things that you might use for clocks, atomic clocks. they can have very good quality. in fact, there are some results that have tremendous performance across a number of those types of trapped-ion qubits in terms of their two-qubit gate qualities. but they\u2019re slow. in terms of the clock rates of getting your operations in, getting your operations out, you do operations to recycle the ion sometimes. and that\u2019s where it, i\u2019d say, has a downside. i\u2019d say, right now, superconducting qubits and trapped ions are the approaches that have the most prominence at the moment that have been put out in terms of usable services. atoms have also emerged; it\u2019s very similar to the trapped ions. there, they use these fun little things called to hold atoms into little arrays. and there are some exciting results that have been coming out from various atom groups there. but again, it comes down to that speed. anytime you have these actual atomic items, either an ion or an atom, your clock rates end up hurting you. i think overall, in the landscape, we\u2019re always keeping track of what\u2019s going on. you\u2019re always seeing what are the latest innovations in the various different technologies. the whole systems are completely different. the architectures are not so compatible. at some level, with your nodes of your semiconductors, there might be certain kinds of know-how that translate how you route and layout, maybe. and here, above a certain layer, there\u2019s also going to be commonality in terms of the compute platform, how the quantum circuits are generated. the software layers might be similar, but the actual physical hardware are very different. i mean, we\u2019re pretty confident. we\u2019re pretty confident in superconducting qubits. it\u2019s why we\u2019re able to prognosticate 10 years forward, that we see the direction we\u2019re going. and to me it\u2019s more that there are going to be innovations within that are going to continue to compound over those 10 years, that might make it even more attractive as time goes on. and that\u2019s just the nature of technology. there\u2019s the near-term stuff, obviously, and the roadmap serves as that guide. that roadmap is constructed so that all these various things do impact that long-term delivery. \u201cit\u2019s mainly an inertia thing to move entire industries, move banks, move commerce, to adopt those standards\u201d yeah, that is a great question. i mean, we have a number of us who are sitting there. we certainly know that we have certain types of technical foundations that we know that we need to include into these next-generation chips and systems. for this roadmap, we said, \u201cwe know at some point we need to get quantum error correction into our roadmap.\u201d and with that technical lead, we know what are the requirements? so first we said, \u201cokay, let\u2019s put it here. now let\u2019s work backward. it says that we need to do this innovation and this innovation by this date, and this other innovation in the software stack or whatever by this date.\u201d and then we say, \u201coh shoot, we ran out of time. let\u2019s move back a little bit.\u201d and so we do a little bit of that planning, because we also want to do it so that we lay out this roadmap that we often call no-regrets decisions. we don\u2019t want to do things that are just for the near term. we want to really pick strategies that give us this long-term path. it\u2019s why we talk about utility scale so much in terms of what we can do with herons and soon flamingos. but everything that we want to build on top of what we can do there will translate to what we can do when we get those systems at scale, including error correction. and in terms of the roadmap planning\u2026 we\u2019re not done, by the way. we have this overall framework for the 10-year roadmap, and then we need to refine. we\u2019ve got a lot of details still to come to work on in terms of what are those things that need to be worked on across the software layer, the compiler layer, the control electronics layer, and certainly at the processor layer. i think the point is, our mission is to bring useful quantum computing to the world. i\u2019ve been working in this area for 20 years now. we\u2019ve never been this close to being able to build something that is driving real value. and so i think when you look at our team, we are all aligned along that mission. that we want to drive this to something that\u2026 we started with just getting it out there in the cloud in terms of building the community. now, we fundamentally see this as a tool that will alter how users are going to perform computation. and so there has to be, and i expect there to be, value there. and we\u2019ve seen how the hpc community has progressed and we\u2019ve seen how supercomputing has... you could see what\u2019s happening with the uptake of ai and everything. we build it, we will build the community around it, we\u2019ll drive value. what\u2019s happened in ai is phenomenal, but we\u2019re not at the point where the quantum computer is this commodity item that we\u2019re just buying tons of chips. you\u2019re not fabricating millions of these chips. but we are going to build this supercomputer based off of quantum computing, which is going to be exquisitely good at certain types of tasks. and so the framework that i actually see is \u2026 already you\u2019re going to have your ai compute clusters. the way that people run workloads today, i\u2019m sure they are running some parts on their regular computers, on their own laptops, but parts of the job get fed out to the cloud, to their hyperscalers, and some of them are going to use the ai compute nodes. we see that also for how quantum will feed in. it\u2019ll be another part of that overall cloud access landscape where you\u2019re going to take a problem, you\u2019re going to break it down. you\u2019re going to have parts of it that run on classical computing, parts of it that might run on ai, parts of it that will leverage what we call quantum-centric supercomputing. that\u2019s the best place to solve that one part of the problem. then it comes back, and you\u2019ve got to stitch all that together. so from the ibm perspective, where we often talk about hybrid cloud, that\u2019s the hybrid cloud that connects all these pieces together. and differentiation is there in terms of building this quantum-centric supercomputer within there. i would say this. so when i was first working in this area and did in this area \u2014 i worked on superconducting qubits \u2014 we required these large canisters, these refrigerators, where we need to wheel up these huge jugs of liquid helium and fill them every three days to keep them cold. now, that\u2019s a physics experiment. i mean, there have already been innovations in cryogenics that they\u2019re turnkey: you plug them in, they stay running, they can run for years and maintain your payloads at the right temperatures. you\u2019re paying electricity, obviously, to keep them cold. but we\u2019re seeing innovations there, too, in terms of driving infrastructure-scale cryogenics. honestly, we\u2019re going to evolve the data center of the future, just like data centers today have evolved to handle increased compute resources needed. we will work hand in hand with how to build these quantum data centers, and we\u2019re already doing that. so we have a quantum data center up in poughkeepsie, which hosts the majority of our systems, and we\u2019re planning on expanding that further. there are certainly threads of that type of discourse, especially throughout the community. personally, what i see is, the encryption one, we already know that there are quantum-safe encryption standards. and a fun thing is, in terms of ibm quantum, our mission is to bring useful quantum computing to the world. the other side of it is make the world quantum-safe. we want to actually help clients figure out how to update their encryption standards to those quantum-safe ones. they exist. a number of them, which it\u2019s mainly an inertia thing to move entire industries, move banks, move commerce, to adopt those standards. yeah, right. exactly, that\u2019s the challenge. and it\u2019s almost a social challenge that needs to be overcome to make that happen. removing that, if we look across at what you can or cannot do on quantum computers, i honestly think we need to just watch what\u2019s happening with ai, see what\u2019s been done in the past with high-performance computing. again, not everybody has a high-performance computer at home. and so we expect a lot of the frameworks to be very similar. and so my concern about putting too many safeguards around it early is stifling progress, is stifling the development early. that\u2019s right. no, we\u2019re not at that stage yet, i\u2019d say. but there are    . there are things that are looking at it, and i think there\u2019s a lot to lean on in terms of learning from what\u2019s happening right now with those ai stories. \u201cit\u2019s always cool to see tremendous excitement about computing capabilities\u201d it\u2019s actually really cool. something that we\u2019re talking about at our computing summit, too, is that we have watsonx at ibm, and we actually brought in some genai methods to help users program in qiskit. so there\u2019s actually an engine that we built there to help users code that we\u2019re going to be previewing. and then another thing is that translating problems into the right circuits that can run on physical hardware is a very challenging task. it, in itself, is an optimization task in terms of there\u2019s a particular problem you want to run, and my hardware is configured in this particular way. we call that transpilation: how to map one to the other. and our teams actually used ai methods to find basically more optimal paths of that mapping. it\u2019s actually really fun in that ai impacts how we can accelerate quantum. there\u2019s another flip side, which is we are looking into how quantum can actually boost classification methods for ai. so it\u2019s all tied together in some ways here. this ai transpilation thing did come in all of a sudden and is part of our roadmap. it\u2019s an innovation, and now we want to feed it into something that we want to drive toward product. so in that micro sense, it has. in the more macro sense, i just say that it\u2019s always cool to see tremendous excitement about computing capabilities. if the buzz stayed more on the ai and let quantum off the hook for a little bit, it\u2019s not so bad. i\u2019m not the foremost expert about what molecular problems can be solved here. but i can at least say that we know that there are certain sizes and certain scales of problems that, in terms of supercomputing resources, push summit, push frontier to its max limits of what users can actually simulate. again, i don\u2019t know how much of that can actually be looked at using ai for approximate methods, but even then, it\u2019d still be approximate methods. and here\u2019s where quantum is really going to be something that allows one to look at it differently. there are those that are using various materials. for example, department of energy, oak ridge national lab, those that already use high-performance computing. they are super interested in using our platforms. boeing actually has been working with us for quite a bit. they\u2019re just looking at super tough problems like composites of materials and layers of materials and how best to arrange them. and they have problems with thousands of variables that are tremendous, that basically cannot work on classical computers. and we\u2019ve been working with them to understand how to map their problems into quantum. and then you have the financial services industry. you have a number of players there that are looking at things like portfolio optimization, trying to understand all these things. they\u2019re still owned by ibm. they\u2019re actually managed services deployed on the premises of the client locations. so we have one actually that, earlier this year, is with . that\u2019s probably the most interesting place that we\u2019ve deployed a system, in that it\u2019s . people have their morning coffees and eat their lunch around it. you can think of it as a self-contained, local managed service that they\u2019re able to build a network and ecosystem around with their researchers, other partner university institutions that might want to use it. so that\u2019s sort of the idea. again, we have our main data center and cloud-accessible systems as you had mentioned. and you have these other ones that you drive regional ecosystems. and we\u2019re actually launching a european data center around our system over in germany next year because, in different locations, people care about how their data is handled. and so then you never have to send information overseas and things like that. so at that level, we can certainly build that type of flexibility into how we manage that service in terms of user data and everything. even with our system ones, we\u2019ve actually upgraded those over time. and again with our roadmap, some of them, we in fact first launched with 27-qubit falcons. as an example, we just announced that our system in japan with the university of tokyo got upgraded to a 127-qubit eagle processor. but in terms of the infrastructure from system one to system two, it\u2019s wholly different. so system one is great in that it first showed that we can put these things almost anywhere \u2014 a cafeteria, for example. you didn\u2019t have to be in a physics laboratory for them to function. yeah. like i say, you have your morning coffee\u2026 \u2026next to a really, really cold 15 millikelvin quantum processor. it\u2019s hard to miss. [ ] it\u2019s this glass box that is... actually, funny story is that we work with this vendor, goppion, that actually handles the glass that encases the mona lisa to help build the enclosures for our systems. yeah. so system two: whole new level of infrastructure. but it\u2019s designed to scale. and so that\u2019s where certainly upgradeability and modularity is inherently built into it. you want to increase the number of processors, increase the cryogenic cooling environment? we can do that. like lego, like modular blocks. you want to increase the amount of control electronics? we can do that. you want to increase the amount of classical computation to interface with the quantum computer? we can do that, too. that\u2019s the idea behind system two, that it\u2019s really designed for scalability in a modular way within a data center environment. i\u2019d say that you\u2019ve just got to be looking out at the fact that it\u2019s actually not hard to get started and learn about it. there\u2019s an entire set of resources that you can go and program a quantum computer tomorrow. and the fact that we have this 10-year roadmap, and the fact that we are building this ecosystem and driving toward these new generations of chips and systems, we want to develop the developer of the future. and so if you\u2019re at all interested in learning about using a quantum computer and getting involved, there\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for growth here. and we\u2019re going to need that. to build an entire industry, and to build this as a computer platform that works together seamlessly with today\u2019s most high-performance computers, is going to require a groundswell of people. so to me, you touch so many different people out there, it\u2019s like, get out there. you can run and program a quantum computer tomorrow. we have freely available systems to run circuits on. yeah. i\u2019d say that the first few ant-man movies, some of the quantum focus was interesting, it was cute. but the most recent one where they had an entire civilization inside, oof. that was a little rough. yeah, you\u2019re very welcome. glad to be here. a podcast about big ideas and other problems. / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"}
