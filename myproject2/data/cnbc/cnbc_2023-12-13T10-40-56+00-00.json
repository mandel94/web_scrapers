assessing how to continue growing the business despite the difficult macroeconomic environment; and pushing for the sound use of data to make better decisions as a business. \"there's many companies similar to pleo who are going through ... balancing growth and efficiency or profitability in the environment that we operating in right now,\" lonning said. \"obviously, we want to continue to to grow and grow fast, but the environment also changed. that's a dilemma for companies, but even more so for the lifestyle of pleo and tech companies.\" \"so i think i can contribute in that direction, making sure we get as good as possible resource allocation across the company in terms of, you know, finding, finding the pockets where we get most bang for the buck in investing.\" while pleo says it is not in a rush to go public, appointing a new cfo is a symbolic move that indicates a company is beefing up its accounting and compliance teams and systems in preparation of an eventual stock market listing. jeppe rindom, pleo's ceo, told cnbc the firm is \"continuously evaluating various options to fuel expansion that best serve our customers.\" an ipo, he said, is an \"important consideration,\" but \"no definitive plans have been set in motion.\" \"part of the responsible decision-making that's guided us to where we are now is an awareness of how market conditions impact public tech companies and understanding if a decision like this would be in the best interest of pleo and our stakeholders,\" rindom said. \"adding s\u00f8ren to our team is about bolstering our financial strategies and comes at a time of high growth for pleo driven by market expansion and investments to win mid-market customers,\" he added. however, rindom added that the stage of maturity pleo has reached as a business means that it's \"only prudent\" to start thinking about the question of an eventual ipo, and suggested the firm wants to be ready for such an event by 2025. \"if you look at the markets today, it's hard to be optimistic because there's been ipos this year and, quite honestly, they haven't been performing super well,\" he said. \"so we don't see ourselves go to market in this context.\" \"but we are thoughtful, and we think we need to be ready for eventually, in order to be ready in, let's say, two years, there are certain things you need to think of already now. and so we're starting to adapt to that mindset of it.\" hiring a cfo like lonning, rindom said, provides pleo with enough \"optionality\" for an ipo, adding that pleo is upgrading its processes around accounting, risk and compliance in order to \"mature in a way that also resonates with an ipo eventually, should that be needed.\" pleo has recently made early moves into the world of credit. the company recently launched overdrafts for customers, as part of a larger product revamp earlier this year. the company said it wants to offer more credit products in the future. pleo has built a business around a product that financial executives \u2014 from cfos to senior accountants \u2014 can use to get visibility over their cash flows and make better decisions about how to manage expenses. lending is viewed as more lucrative path for financial firms than payment fees since they can earn interest from cash lent out to customers \u2014 especially now when interest rates are higher. founded in copenhagen in 2015, pleo offers a single platform attached to a company-branded card that lets companies track their spending as well as file and organize their expenses. the firm, which was last privately valued at $4.7 billion, competes with the likes of sap's concur, as well as startups including u.s. firm brex, u.k.-based soldo, and france's spendesk. the firm has raised more than $434 million in funding to date, and is backed by the likes of coatue, bain capital ventures, thrive capital, creandum, and seedcamp."},

of safety, flight operations and regulatory affairs, has departed the company, cnbc has learned. cassidy was amazon's primary liaison with the federal aviation administration as it worked to get the necessary regulatory approvals to expand the program. amazon's drone program was hit hard by layoffs earlier this year, and it has been beset by regulatory setbacks. the program cleared a key regulatory hurdle in october, however, when the faa loosened restrictions on how and where its drones can fly. amazon has lost a high-profile executive in its drone delivery unit who was the company's primary liaison with federal regulators, cnbc has learned. sean cassidy, prime air's director of safety, flight operations and regulatory affairs, announced his departure from the company last week in an internal note to employees, a copy of which was viewed by cnbc. amazon hired cassidy, a former alaska airlines pilot and vice president of the world's largest pilots union, in 2015 to oversee strategic partnerships in the drone program. \"this is my last day at prime air and at amazon, so a quick note to pass along my profound thanks to so many of my friends and colleagues here who have made this nearly nine year journey such an amazing experience,\" cassidy wrote in the memo. cassidy oversaw much of amazon's relations with the federal aviation administration as it sought to get the ambitious drone delivery program, a pet project of amazon founder jeff bezos, off the ground. bezos predicted a decade ago that a fleet of amazon drones would take to the skies in about five years, dropping packages on customers' doorsteps in 30 minutes or less. that vision hasn't materialized as quickly as bezos hoped. amazon did not immediately respond to cnbc's request for comment about cassidy's departure. in august 2020, amazon received part 135 certification from the faa, allowing it to use drones to deliver packages, but with some restrictions. last year, amazon announced it would begin testing drone deliveries in two small markets in california and texas. but just as the program appeared to be set to expand, prime air in january was by affected layoffs as part of broader job cuts at amazon. it has also been beset with regulatory setbacks and has struggled to meet delivery goals. in august, the unit lost two executives key to its operations, cnbc previously reported . david carbon, amazon's drone delivery head and a former boeing executive, previously set an internal target to make 10,000 deliveries in 2023 between its two test sites. amazon said in october that its drones have \"safely delivered hundreds of household items\" in college station, texas, since december 2022, and it's beginning medication delivery by drone in the area. the announcement didn't say how many deliveries have been made in lockeford, california, the company's other test site. in late october, amazon cleared a significant regulatory hurdle when the faa amended restrictions that dictated where and how its drones could fly. cassidy wrote to the faa in july asking that the agency allow amazon to fly drones out of sight of a \"visual observer,\" or an employee who keeps an eye on the drone while it's in flight to make sure it avoids hazards, according to government filings. cassidy said prime air had spent years developing a \"detect-and-avoid\" system for its mk27-2 drone, which allows the vehicle to steer clear of aircraft, people and pets, as well as static objects such as chimneys, eliminating the need for visual observers. on oct. 23, the faa granted amazon's request and loosened restrictions on where its drones can operate, permitting it to fly over roadways and cars when necessary to complete a route. some restrictions remain intact, such as rules prohibiting drones from flying over open-air assemblies of people, and schools during times of operation. it hasn't been entirely smooth sailing entirely since then. the national transportation safety board is investigating a nov. 10 crash at amazon's drone test site in pendleton, oregon, according to a federal crash report viewed by cnbc. the drone sustained \"substantial\" damage during the incident, but no one was injured, and there were no fires or explosions at the site. the ntsb said it's conducting a class 4 investigation into the incident, which it considers to be more limited in scope versus other probes. it comes after a separate incident at the pendleton site in june, where a drone made an emergency landing in a field and was destroyed. amazon said at the time it tests its drone systems \"up to their limits and beyond,\" and that it reported the incident to regulators. watch: amazon drones lagging far behind alphabet's wing and walmart partner zipline don't miss these

come under fire from critics who question how an $86 billion company can be controlled by a charity.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/12/openai-nonprofit-arm-45000-in-2022-revenue-company-worth-billions.html", "author": "jordan novet", "body": "openai's nonprofit organization generated $44,485 in revenue in 2022, almost entirely from investment income, according to a document filed with the internal revenue service. the filing doesn't disclose revenue from openai's for-profit division, which is commercializing chatgpt. openai's nonprofit status has come under fire from critics who question how an $86 billion company can be controlled by a charity. openai is valued by private investors at $86 billion , due in part to the popularity of chatgpt. but if you're looking for a revenue figure for the red-hot artificial intelligence startup, the latest official number you'll find is the tiny sum of $44,485 for last year. that's from the nonprofit parent's 990 filing with the internal revenue service, a form that has to be filled out by organizations wishing to maintain their tax-exempt status. openai shared the document with cnbc, and the website plainsite published the filing last week. federal standards don't require audited financial statements from nonprofits. in its home state of california, openai was able to avoid submitting audited financials for 2022 because the foundation's stated revenue was below the $2 million reporting threshold. the last time openai filed with the state was 2017, when revenue was $33.2 million, or more than 700 times what the foundation reported for 2022. for all its talk of openness, openai's financials remain a black box. created as a nonprofit in 2015, openai launched a so-called capped-profit entity in 2019, enabling it to raise billions of dollars in outside funding and attain attributes of a tech startup, such as the ability to hand out equity to employees. the for-profit side of the house went on to develop chatgpt, the chatbot that took the world by storm late last year and kicked off the generative ai boom. the information reported in august that openai generated $28 million in revenue last year and will likely approach $1 billion in 2023, reflecting the surge in popularity for chatgpt and enhancements to openai's models. openai's latest irs filing adds to the confusion that surfaced last month, when the nonprofit's board, which oversees the entire entity, abruptly fired ceo sam altman, explaining in a blog post that it \"no longer has confidence\" in altman's ability to lead, and that \"we believe new leadership is necessary as we move forward.\" reports quickly surfaced that the board was angry about altman's push to bring commercial products to market despite safety concerns at a nonprofit that was designed \"with the goal of building safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity.\" just days later, altman was back at the helm after employees threatened a mass exodus and major investors worked to reverse the board's move. altman said on x, formerly known as twitter, that \"there were real misunderstandings between me and members of the board.\" concurrent with his reinstatement, helen toner, tasha mccauley and co-founder ilya sutskever were removed as board members. the chaos has called into question whether openai can or should continue under the umbrella of a nonprofit. thad calabrese, a professor of public and nonprofit financial management at new york university, said openai's current status is confusing, and is unlike anything he has seen in the nonprofit world. he said openai could give up its nonprofit status, and he cited the blue cross blue shield association, which in 1994 allowed associated nonprofit medical insurance plans to switch into for-profit entities. \"there's no real need to have the nonprofit,\" calabrese said. \"if you want to be a startup, be a startup.\" regarding openai's reporting with the irs, he said \"fundamentally you can't really get a holistic sense of these organizations when you don't have consolidated financial statements.\" an openai spokesperson didn't respond to a question about whether the organization is considering giving up its nonprofit status. he said openai has always complied with california's filing requirements. the nonprofit model isn't entirely foreign to the tech industry. the mozilla foundation is the parent entity of the mozilla corporation, whose products include the firefox browser. unlike openai, mozilla never raised money from venture and corporate investors, who expect returns on their investments. the corporation reinvests the majority of its revenue into product development and sets some aside for the nonprofit's programs. each year, the mozilla foundation posts an updated 990 document on its website, along with an audited financial statement and a more thorough annual report. mark surman, president of the mozilla foundation, said openai needs to figure out which direction it wants to take. \"i don't know at this point that this is a regulatory oversight issue. i think this is a public trust issue,\" surman said in an interview. \"if they want to be seen as this public institution making sure ai is in the service of humanity, we need a lot more transparency. we need to know what's going on.\" meanwhile, an active tender offer enabling openai employees to sell their shares will value the startup at $86 billion, cnbc reported last week. the company has raised billions of dollars from investors, principally microsoft , to pay for cloud services and hire the talent needed to develop its capital-intensive large language models. it's a very different picture from the 990 filing, which showed $1.3 million in expenses at the nonprofit last year, including about $400,000 in grants, mainly to fund duke university research. the filing also mentioned seven achievements in 2022, most notably chatgpt and the dall-e 2 tool for generating images from words. \"each of the organization's related organizations is legally bound to pursue the organization's mission, such as following uncompromised principles of safety and broad benefit in its research and deployment efforts, unencumbered by profit incentives,\" openai said in the filing. following altman's return last month, openai committed to enhancing its governance structure, though it hasn't offered specific changes that are coming. current board chair and former salesforce co-ceo bret taylor said in a statement friday that \"the board will continue to take steps to strengthen openai's corporate governance, build a qualified and diverse board of exceptional individuals, and oversee openai's important mission in ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.\" read the 990 filing here: watch:  the ftc and the uk's cma

google then booted the game out of its store, spurring the lawsuit. the decision could give app makers a bigger revenue share of the digital app market, which is currently dominated by google and apple, and is worth about $200 billion per year. the loss for google could also empower other antitrust-based challenges to the search giant's business, including a similar case brought by the department of justice. monday's unanimous verdict came after a four-week trial in federal court in california. the jury found that google acquired and maintained monopoly power in the android app distribution market, as well as the in-app billing market for digital goods and services transactions. the result is markedly different than epic games' similar effort to change apple's app store, in which which it lost 9 of 10 counts in 2021 . its only win was a judgment to suspend a rule about being able to email app customers. that ruling is currently being appealed to the supreme court. one major difference was that epic had a harder time finding documentation from inside apple. another is that google's android allows software to be installed from the internet, a process called sideloading, while apple bars it. \"the big difference between apple and google is apple didn't write anything down. and because they're a big vertically integrated monopoly, they don't do deals with developers and carriers to shut down competition, they just simply block at the technical level,\" sweeney said. during the google trial, epic games instead focused on whether google locked up the app store market through deals with handset makers, and whether it scared users away from using android's sideloading functionality through security warnings. it specifically called out secretive revenue-sharing contract deals with samsung and chinese handset makers, which these partners allegedly signed in exchange for supporting the google play store on new devices. it also revealed that google had entered into talks with epic games over an investment in the fortnite maker. u.s. district judge james donato will hold hearings in january to determine what changes google will have to make. google might have to alter its google play store rules, including opening up an option for billing and distribution outside of the store. epic will push for lower fees, alternatives to google play and less scary warnings about installing software from the internet, sweeney said. he added that epic games is not seeking monetary damages. sweeney is not optimistic that change will be immediate. \"if google is obstructing a vertical remedy through appeals and isn't offering an awesome deal,\" sweeney said, the company will not be on google's services. google said it will appeal the decision. google previously reached settlements with consumers, state attorneys generals and match group over google's app store policies. \"we plan to challenge the verdict,\" wilson white, google vice president for government affairs and public policy, said in a statement. \"android and google play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform. the trial made clear that we compete fiercely with apple and its app store, as well as app stores on android devices and gaming consoles. we will continue to defend the android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader android ecosystem.\" sweeney does hope that some of google's deals revealed during the trial could give its partners leverage in negotiations. on tuesday, wells fargo analysts cited the risk of partners striking harder bargains in exchange for carrying google's app store or using its billing system. however, investors don't seem to be particularly worried that the result of this trial will threaten google's app business, which could about total $38.5 billion in annual revenue this year, according to an estimate from wells fargo. google stock fell less than 1% during trading tuesday. don't miss these stories from cnbc pro: five stocks to buy before the year end, according to the pros morgan stanley fund manager names 4 top stocks to buy 'on the cheap' jpmorgan picks china stocks to buy now. alibaba's not on the list analysts love this self-driving car tech stock and give it over 400% upside"},

billing model for its app store, which the company counts as one of its \"services\" revenue streams. it could also empower separate antitrust action. wall street has so far shrugged off the news, as google is expected to appeal the ruling, putting off any changes for months to years. a federal jury decided on monday that google's app store has benefited from anticompetitive behavior, but it could take a long time before the company faces any potential changes to the google play store, and those changes are unlikely to hurt revenue significantly. that said, the ruling could give more ammunition to other antitrust cases against the company, even though those cases will likely take years to reach a resolution. epic games originally sued google in 2020, alleging it uses its dominant position as the developer of android to strike deals with handset makers and collect excess fees from consumers. google collects between 15% and 30% for all digital purchases made through its storefront. epic tried to bypass those fees by charging users directly for purchases in the popular game fortnite; google then booted the game out of its store, spurring the lawsuit. after a four-week trial in a northern california federal court monday, a jury unanimously found that google had acquired and maintained monopoly power in the android app distribution market, as well as the in-app billing market for digital goods and services transactions. epic filed a similar suit against apple but lost in federal appeals court in april . in an interview with cnbc, epic ceo tim sweeney attributed the win to revelations during the trial that google had allegedly deleted or failed to keep records such as chats about its secretive deals with app makers. he also noted that it had been a jury trial, while the apple case was decided by a judge. the decision comes as google faces two separate justice department suits in virginia and washington, d.c., related to allegedly anticompetitive behavior . judge james donato of the united states district court for the northern district of california will decide on remedies in the next phase in the coming months. google could be forced to change its play store rules, which is what epic asked for as opposed to monetary relief. the company doesn't break out google play revenue separately, but it is included in its \"google services\" segment, which brought in $67.99 billion in the third quarter of 2023 \u2014 an increase from $61.38 billion the year prior. it earns money from consumer in-app purchases and subscriptions. a wells fargo analyst note tuesday estimates google will book $38.5 billion in google play store billings in 2023. that's about 13% of the company's total expected revenue of $305.7 billion for the year, according to estimates from lseg (formerly refinitiv). epic's victory could force google to change its app store billing model, so it could no longer force app makers to use google's billing system as a condition for distribution through the play store. it could also force google to make changes to its android commission, where it charges a 15% to 30% fee on digital goods and services purchased within apps. the court could force google give other app stores more exposure on its android ecosystem, which has the largest share of the smartphone operating system market worldwide. the google play store comes preinstalled on most android devices, but users can install alternate stores manually.\u00a0the court could require google to allow other app stores equal footing on third-party devices, prevent google from restricting distribution of those app stores, or take other measures to make sure consumers had alternatives. in addition, the information that came to light during the trial could give third parties more negotiating leverage, argued keybanc analysts in a note late monday night. during the trial, epic games called a google executive who testified that google gave spotify a special rate on google play subscription purchases \u2014 only 4%, versus 15% for others. epic games ceo tim sweeney told cnbc tuesday \"i think it's going to be impossible for google business development to avoid giving everybody the spotify deal at this point, and we'll see, i hope, i hope journalists give that a good amount of scrutiny.\" other financial information also came out during the trial. for instance, pichai revealed that google pays apple 36% of safari search revenue under the terms of a default search agreement that is core to the justice department's separate antitrust claims. epic's attorney then alleged that google pays samsung, android's largest hardware partner, less than half of what it pays to apple. pichai replied that while he didn't know for certain, it was possible. it will be a while before any potential changes come to pass. google denied any wrongdoing and says it will appeal the verdict, so it could be tied up in appeals court for years. \"the trial made clear that we compete fiercely with apple and its app store, as well as app stores on android devices and gaming consoles,\" wrote wilson white, vp, government affairs & public policy in a statement. \"we will continue to defend the android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader android ecosystem.\" analysts noted tuesday they expect a multi-year process before any changes would likely come to pass. \"google's epic loss is much ado about nothing,\" wrote needham analysts. worst case scenario, needham analysts argued, was that \"google loses all appeals and must add competitors, though it's unclear consumers would move,\" they stipulated. \"also, google could charge new competitors to the play store a revenue share of 15%+ so that the new competitors would have to charge consumers higher fees that includes google's 'overhead' charge.\" however, the verdict does have the potential to arm separate antitrust action against the search giant \u2014 ones that are closer to the heart of the company's core revenue streams. some analysts have noted that the loss for google could influence an ongoing similar case brought by the department of justice. investors are awaiting more details of potential remedies to react strongly one way or another. alphabet's stock barely moved upon news of the verdict, and closed down less than 1% on tuesday. cnbc tech reporter kif leswing contributed to this report."},

google\u2019s android app store has been protected by anticompetitive barriers that have damaged smartphones and software developers.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/12/googles-android-app-store-benefits-from-anticompetitive-barriers.html", "body": "a federal court jury has decided that google's android app store has been protected by anticompetitive barriers that have damaged smartphone consumers and software developers, dealing a blow to a major pillar of a technology empire. the unanimous verdict reached monday came after just three hours of deliberation following a four-week trial revolving around a lucrative payment system within google's play store. the store is the main place where hundreds of millions of people around the world download and install apps that work on smartphones powered by google's android software. epic games, the maker of the popular fortnite video game, filed a lawsuit against google three years ago, alleging that the internet search giant has been abusing its power to shield its play store from competition in order to protect a gold mine that makes billions of dollars annually. just as apple does for its iphone app store, google collects a commission ranging from 15% to 30% on digital transactions completed within apps. apple  prevailed in a similar case that epic brought against the iphone app store. but that 2021 trial was decided by a federal judge in a ruling that is under appeal at the u.s. supreme court. the nine-person jury in the play store case apparently saw things through a different lens, even though google technically allows android apps to be downloaded from different stores \u2014 an option that apple prohibits on the iphone. just before the play store trial started, google sought to avoid having a jury determine the outcome, only to have its request rejected by u.s. district judge james donato. now it will be up to donato to determine what steps google will have to take to unwind its illegal behavior in the play store. the judge indicated he will hold hearings on the issue during the second week of january. epic ceo tim sweeney broke into a wide grin after the verdict was read and slapped his lawyers on the back and also shook the hand of a google attorney, whom he thanked for his professional attitude during the proceedings. \"victory over google!\" sweeney wrote in a post on x, the platform formerly known as twitter. in a company post , epic hailed the verdict as \"a win for all app developers and consumers around the world.\" google plans to appeal the verdict, according to a statement from wilson white, the company's vice president of government affairs and public policy. \"android and google play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform,\" white said. depending on how the judge enforces the jury's verdict, google could lose billions of dollars in annual profit generated from its play store commissions. the company's main source of revenue \u2014 digital advertising tied mostly to its search engine, gmail and other services \u2014 won't be directly affected by the trial's outcome. the jury reached its decision after listening to two hours of closing arguments from the lawyers on the opposing sides of the case. epic lawyer gary bornstein depicted google as a ruthless bully that deploys a \"bribe and block\" strategy to discourage competition against its play store for android apps. google lawyer jonathan kravis attacked epic as a self-interested game maker trying to use the courts to save itself money while undermining an ecosystem that has spawned billions of android smartphones to compete against apple and its iphone. much of the lawyers' dueling arguments touched upon the testimony from a litany of witnesses who came to court during the trial. the key witnesses included google ceo sundar pichai, who sometimes seemed like a professor explaining complex topics while standing behind a lectern because of a health issue, and sweeney, who painted himself as a video game lover on a mission to take down a greedy tech titan. in his closing argument for epic, bornstein railed against google for exploiting its power over the android software in a way that \"has led to higher prices for developers and consumers, as well as less innovation and quality.\" google has staunchly defended the commissions as a way to help recoup the more than $40 billion that it has poured into building into the android software that it has been giving away since 2007 to manufacturers to compete against the iphone. \"android phones cannot compete against the iphone without a great app store on them,\" kravis asserted in his closing argument. \"the competition between the app stores is tied to the competition between the phones.\" but bornstein ridiculed the notion of google and android competing against apple and its incompatible iphone software system. \"apple is not the 'get out of jail for free' card that google wants it to be,\" bornstein told the jury. google also pointed to rival android app stores such as the one that samsung installs on its popular smartphones as evidence of a free market. combined with the rival app stores pre-installed on devices made by other companies, more than 60% of android phones offer alternative outlets for android apps. epic, though, presented evidence asserting the notion that google welcomes competition as a pretense, citing the hundreds of billions of dollars it has doled out to companies, such as game maker activision blizzard, to discourage them from opening rival app stores. besides making these payments, bornstein also urged the jury to consider the google \"scare screens\" that pop up, warning consumers of potential security threats when they try to download android apps from some of the alternatives to the play store. \"these are classic anticompetitive strategies used by dominant firms to protect their monopolies,\" bornstein said. google's empire could be further undermined by another major antitrust trial in washington that will be decided by a federal judge after hearing final arguments in may. that trial has cast a spotlight on google's cozy relationship with apple in online search, the technology that turned google into a household word a few years after two former stanford university graduate students started the company in a silicon valley garage in 1998."},

foreign direct investments have bounced back stronger. warren buffett's first international acquisition, industrials company iscar, is based in israel and he doubled down on it after the second lebanon war. often referred to as \"startup nation\" for its tech research and development strength, 15 israeli companies have been selected to cnbc's disruptor 50 list, among the highest national counts after the u.s. anchored in a culture of entrepreneurship and adaptability, israel is globally recognized as the world's \"startup nation\" for its cross-sector contributions to modern research and technology. however, the horrific events of october 7 shifted our focus from innovation to self-defense. in just a few hours, the nation of israel went from business as usual to national emergency and national mourning. throughout this ongoing crisis, the resilience of israel's economy has once again taken center stage. despite the challenging security situation, israeli companies have stood strong in demonstrating business continuity and delivering world-class services to customers across the globe. this should be no surprise, as resilience has always been a key tenet of israel's long-term success, military or otherwise. examples, unfortunately, abound: whether during the global financial crisis of 2008-09, operation protective edge in 2014 or other past challenges, israel's gdp, exports and foreign direct investments have always bounced back from crises stronger than ever. most recently, the covid-19 pandemic struck a terrible blow to israel's economy in the second quarter of 2020, reducing gdp by roughly 30% annualized. but israel quickly rebounded, growing nearly 40% the following quarter and more than 8.5% the next year, well above the oecd average of 5.7%. before the tumultuous days of the second lebanon war, warren buffett chose israel as the destination for berkshire hathaway 's first international investment \u2014 buying 80% of iscar, a metalworking company located near the lebanese border, valuing it at $5 billion. when the conflict began, buffett was resolute, and maintained his investment despite iscar's proximity to the border and its frequent exposure to rocket attacks. this clear-eyed, long-term decision ultimately yielded substantial gains. by the time buffett bought the remaining stake in iscar in 2013, its valuation had doubled to $10 billion. this rebound was reflected in the israeli economy as a whole. the tel aviv stock exchange's flagship ta-125 index dropped over 8% in that war's opening days, but took only 40 days to recover to pre-war levels. similarly, following the attacks of october 7, the ta-125 fell over 12%, and as expected, returned almost fully to its prewar territory in just two months. loading chart... numerous initiatives emerged immediately after the hamas attacks to support affected companies. vehicles such as the israeli innovation authority's (iia) fast track funding mechanism alongside private sector designated funds and business support tools such as safe dome, iron nation and the frontline initiative quickly materialized. israel's ministry of economy with its 45 overseas economic missions held and continues to hold hundreds of investment events in a global effort to support israeli startup companies, while the ministry of finance recently quadrupled the iia's fast-track fund as it adapts and responds to the evolving needs of israeli companies. beyond top-down initiatives, we are witnessing a continued stream of private investment in israeli startups as well as additional recognition by international business leaders in the quality of israeli innovation. examples from just last week include israeli data security startup mine's raising a $30 million series b co-led by paypal ventures, and the release of a mckinsey report naming israel as no. 1 in the world in terms of both investment per capita and as a share of gdp for the rapidly expanding mobility sector. it is also noteworthy that 15 israeli companies have been selected to cnbc's disruptor 50 list since its establishment, among the highest national counts after the u.s., and including four companies from the 2023 list : wiz, orca security, snyk and beehero. this is especially impressive since both now and in past conflicts, israel's tech sector employees were drafted to defend their homeland. many startups found their team members on the battlefield by day and managing their business by night. as israel's economic minister to north america, i have personally witnessed more visits to israel than i can count conducted by investors and business leaders during the past two months \u2014 visits to show solidarity as well as to promote business opportunities. the u.s. chamber of commerce, the world's largest business organization, strongly condemned the terrorist attacks and has led the american business community in providing humanitarian and other support to israel. leaders of over 850 leading venture capital firms issued a bold statement of support for israel , encouraging the global venture community to \"support and engage with israeli startups, entrepreneurs, and investors.\" it is evident that israel is already rebounding, and it's the most knowledgeable and seasoned investors who are taking advantage of this profound opportunity.\u00a0even in this moment of difficulty, israeli innovators and entrepreneurs are already looking ahead to the day after. israel's innovation ecosystem continues to offer myriad possibilities for collaboration, investment and business partnerships. our message to the world is clear: israel is and always will be open for business. no matter what. \u2014 by  anat katz, economic minister to north america for israel's ministry

(tate has sued the accusers who made those charges.) x has allowed tate to monetize his account and tate has said that he generated tens of thousands of dollars on x, previously. while musk \u2014 who is also ceo of tesla and spacex \u2014 bills himself as a free speech defender, he has wielded his control of the x platform to suspend the accounts of perceived enemies and vocal critics there. for example, x suspended the accounts of software developer travis brown , a same-day private jet tracker account built by jack sweeney , and aaron greenspan , the founder of legal and public records database plainsite. under musk's management, x has also sued a progressive watchdog group, media matters for america, and one of its staff members alleging defamation. the suit followed an investigative report mmfa published that said blatantly nazi content ran on the social network alongside ads from mainstream brands there. musk has faced a backlash for changes he's made at twitter since taking over the platform in late october 2022, including the widespread reversal of account suspensions. he famously reversed the suspension of former president donald trump. in recent weeks, many major advertisers suspended their campaigns on x after musk promoted what the white house called \"antisemitic and racist hate\" on the site. musk would go on to tell those advertisers to \"go f**k yourselves,\" and \"don't advertise,\" from the stage of the 2023 dealbook summit in new york."},

their music including recreating their own voices in multiple new versions. some top artists recently licensed their voices to youtube for ai, including john legend, sia and demi lovato. ai is beginning to threaten human artists with issues of increased competition and copyright infringement, though the chainsmokers said at the cnbc work summit that fans will always be more drawn to a human connection. generative ai poses a challenge to the idea that creativity is uniquely human. music is an art form where experiments testing this edge are multiplying, and raising tensions. ai can make the music production process easier and more accessible, but it's also beginning to threaten many artists , songwriters, and producers, diluting the market and raising legal copyright issues. despite the unknowns, the chainsmokers, the popular dj duo consisting of drew taggart and alex pall, are ai optimists. \"as an artist, i want every possible tool to make my art better,\" said taggart at this week's cnbc work summit. \"the only answer is to embrace [ai] and figure out a way to harness it.\" figuring it out has taken the artists to a financial model in addition to their artistic one \u2014 the chainsmokers have their own venture capital business, mantis vc , including a series of funds nearing $1 billion in assets that have made ai, among other, investments. ai can replicate every stage of song production, leading to situations in which spotify has already had to remove thousands of ai generated songs. it can write song lyrics, create a melody, add a beat, and sing the song using ai-generated vocals. there are some upsides \u2014 it's increasing the democratization of music, allowing anyone to create a track from their own bedrooms. and with today's social media algorithms, any song has the potential to explode overnight. in april, ai-generated music made headlines when ghostwriter, a previously unknown artist, used ai-generated vocals of drake and the weeknd to produce viral hit \"heart on my sleeve.\" now, ai-generated music is dominating social media, with ai covers of famous songs made by other artists taking over tiktok for you pages and youtube recommended feeds. the covers are even competing with the original songs: an ariana grande ai cover of korean song everytime, for example, received over 7.6 million views and became the top-liked search result for the song on tiktok. given the tensions, corporations are trying to include artists. youtube recently announced its dream track experiment , which will allow users to use ai-generated versions of select artists as soundtracks for their creator videos. the star-studded lineup of available artists include alec benjamin, charlie puth, charli xcx, demi lovato, john legend, sia, t-pain, troye sivan and papoose. for the chainsmokers, using ai-generated vocals in their own music is appealing. \"i want to be able to write a song and be able to design my own voice that's not mine. i want five voices that are mine, but generated off of mine, in a track,\" taggart said. \"i see it as a huge tool that's going to be enabling chainsmokers music to reach a level it hadn't been.\" but anyone can type \"make me a song that sounds like the chainsmokers produced it\" in an ai tool and receive a song in minutes. or, artists can write a song from start to finish, but replace their own vocals with those of more recognizable artists and generate more clicks. copyright law allows artists to protect their creative works and grants them with exclusive rights. and the copyright office issued a formal guidance on ai in march , affirming that only the human aspects of ai-produced work could be copyrighted. in the case of \"heart on my sleeve,\" universal music group was able to use a copyright claim to take the song down from streaming platforms. the digital millennium copyright act allows a rights-holder to request for a violation to be removed. the chainsmokers said they are not opposed to hearing ai-generated music in their style, as long as it was protected. \"it would be cool if someone could make chainsmokers music and couldn't upload it without the permission of us,\" pall said. \"now we have the option to reach out to the person, collaborate with them on the idea, or say 'this is fine, release it.' but there's a framework set up so we're all doing this fairly and legally at the end of the day.\" and the music duo says there is no way to stop the generation of ai music. \"you're definitely going to see a huge influx of content \u2026 but i do think the cream always rises to the top,\" pall said. ai isn't just limited to producing songs \u2014 it also has the potential to take on an identity and become an entirely new artist. in september, warner music group signed its first social media virtual influencer to make music \u2014 noonoouri, a digital character who uses ai for her voice and has over 425,000 followers on instagram , more than some artists could ever dream of amassing. the chainsmokers aren't phased by the ai competition. \"i think what people are favoring right now are feeling like they have a connection to somebody over something that sounds like it should be a hit,\" taggart said. \"the internet is allergic to inauthenticity. so as ai comes in, people will sniff out what's real and what's not. they want to be fans of true artists telling their story. they want something to believe in.\""},

wadhwani, 75, is investing $1 billion of his personal fortune in predictive and generative ai technology. \"what ai will enable in the next five years, we were not able to do in the past 50 years,\" the palo alto-based tech entrepreneur tells cnbc. wadhwani, who started to build his enterprise ai software business early on in 2017, said the strategy is differentiation in vertical niches. \"if only doing horizontal ai, that was already being done by facebook and google, and there was no chance of competing with the behemoths.\" billionaire silicon valley technology leader romesh wadhwani recently celebrated his 75th birthday with 100 friends, reminiscing about many career milestones and only wishing he were 20 years younger in a new, fast-moving era of artificial intelligence. \"ai tech is in an explosive phase right now, when i feel like i am falling behind every week. gen ai is happening weekly. every job, every consumer, every company will be massively transformed,\" he said. wadhwani signed the gates buffet giving pledge to give away the majority of his wealth, but $1 billion of his fortune is currently being bet on predictive and generative ai technology. \"we are going for it, transforming as a gen ai-first company,\" said wadhwani, now chairman and founder of investment firm saigroup and its portfolio of three enterprise ai software technology companies. from his headquarters at stanford research park in palo alto, wadhwani recounted several cycles in ai's development over his 53-year career journey: from the 1970s as a concept, to robotics in the 1980s, to cloud computing and greater computing power in the 1990s, to the 2020s with massive data availability. \"each wave was followed by an ai winter. now, we are moving at lightning speed. ... what ai will enable in the next five years, we were not able to do in the past 50 years,\" he said. market research company forrester forecasts enterprise ai software spending will reach $60.4 billion globally in 2023 and balloon to $227 billion by 2030 while genai will capture 55 percent of this ai software market by the end of the decade. \"there is a sense of urgency,\" said mike gualtieri, vice president and principal analyst at market research group forrester. \"the concern in business is that some company in the industry will be first to use this new ai technology for competitive advantage.\" currently, slightly more than half (53.5%) of large enterprises have adopted ai software, with much smaller percentages among small and medium-sized businesses, according to forrester. far wider use is forecast by forrester by 2030. adobe ceo shantanu narayen, who has known wadhwani in the circle of successful indian immigrants in silicon valley for several years, praised him for being \"very, very early in ai, way before this ai craze.\" from the start, saigroup's strategy was differentiation. \"if only doing horizontal ai, that was already being done by facebook and google, and there was no chance of competing with the behemoths. i did a startup for the most important verticals where ai can provide the most value,\" wadhwani said. the early results for the largest tech companies in the stock market are in, with recent gains propelled by a combination of ai substance and hype. roughly one year since chatgpt's launch in late november 2022, megacap tech and chip makers have surged, with nvidia up roughly 175%, and microsoft gaining nearly 50% tied to the billions of dollars it has invested in chatgpt maker openai. wadhwani began building his enterprise ai software business in 2017, when he says the ai era for business was still early in its development. symphonyai came together through a series of startups and acquisitions, positioned for retail, consumer packaged goods, financial services, manufacturing, media and the public sector. building on the momentum, he expanded the business with two more health industry-specific ai companies. concertai, launched in 2018, is pinpointing biotech.\u00a0rhythmx ai, rolled out this october with a $50 million investment and run by ceo deepthi bathina, former chief clinical product officer at humana, is getting started as a genai-based platform for physicians and healthcare systems to offer personalized patient care. boston-based concertai, split off separately from symphonyai in 2018, has grown revenue by 35% to $160 million. its mission is to accelerate cancer research and match patients with clinical trials. \"his (wadhwani's) vision on how ai, research and healthcare pieces can come together and be transformative plus his commitment, is extraordinary. it is not just an ai investment thesis,\" said ceo jeff elton. last year, concertai scored $150 million in venture capital at a $1.9 billion valuation, and has raised a total $600 million. bristol myers squibb, a concertai customer for five years, uses its software for clinical trials in oncology research. \"it offered a more robust and bespoke option for our clinical trials that didn't exist in the market at that time,\" said jeff conklin, who recently retired as senior vice president and chief analytics officer and had worked with wadhwani to develop and customize oncology research software \u2014 the genesis for concertai. veteran technology executive sanjay dhawan, who previously ran wadhwani-invested symphony teleca and was recruited by wadhwani in early 2022 as symphonyai ceo, said the company recently turned profitable and is approaching $500 million in revenue run rate for 2023, growing by 30 percent yearly. the goal is to take symphonyai public within 18 to 24 months. \"i feel good that the original vision of 2017 is unfolding, and the strategy is paying off,\" wadhwani said. forrester's gualitieri predicts that smaller vendors with domain expertise may have the advantage in moving faster than big companies. but as in prior hyper-cycles for new technologies, the field is getting crowded, even in the verticals where saigroup is focused. it competes with ai enterprise software innovators on two fronts. rivals include vertical specialists such as actimize in fraud protection, roche group-acquired flatiron in biotech, and ansys in product design. also factoring in as rivals are horizontal ai providers, like publicly traded c3.ai and palantir technologies . meanwhile, upstarts in gen ai keep coming such as eric schmidt-funded mistral ai from france, for enterprises. \"no could have predicted ai could do 80% of what it does today,\" said wadhwani, who gets weekly high-tech updates from his team. customers for the group's saas ai tools come from the u.s., europe and asia and include grocery retailers, consumer packaged goods companies, financial services and pharmaceutical makers as well as big company brands procter & gamble, nationwide and pfizer. supermarket chain save a lot recently selected symphonyai technology to better manage its supply chain, after a three-year evaluation of providers. the data-driven retail technology \"stood out as a best-in-class ai solution with a full suite of warehousing, vendor management and forecasting,\" said chief information officer jennifer hopper. a graduate of the indian institute of technology, bombay, wadhwani came to the u.s. from india on a fellowship at carnegie mellon university, where he earned his master's and phd degrees in electrical engineering. he had pioneering ai research scientists allen newell and herbert simon as professors. his first business out of college in pittsburgh was security and energy software company compuguard, a $10 million business sold in 1981 to swiss electrical equipment maker brown boveri. then, in 1982, he signed on as ceo of american robot corporation, backed by the rockefeller family's venture fund venrock. \u00a0struggling to compete with lower-cost japanese robotics makers, he transformed the money-losing business into computer-aided software for manufacturers and returned most of the original vc investment. \"i was putting in work weeks of 80 to 90 hours and earning what amounted to $13 to $14 hourly,\" recalled wadhwani. \"i wasn't a very disciplined operator for the first 20 years of my career. \"but i learned about capital efficiency and how to operate a company with discipline and not just a good vision.\" eager to try his luck in tech capital silicon valley, in 1991, wadhwani convinced his wife to make a move from pittsburgh \"to be where the big dogs are.\" he soon started business-to-business software service aspect development. within 10 years, by 2002, a competitor in the booming e-commerce sector, i2 technologies, bought aspect development for $9.3 billion in stock, and the two companies were combined. wadhwani said he keeps a framed wall street journal article in his office about the deal, then described as the \"largest software deal ever.\" looking for his next challenge, in 2002, he formed private equity firm software technology group. \"i could have done another startup, but i decided instead to do a whole bunch of startups and acquisitions,\" he said. through three funds totaling $1.8 billion with wadhwani as a primary backer, stg invested in 33 companies in the enterprise software space. \"it was an exhilarating, high energy time,\" he said. there were no failures and no shutdowns from those portfolio companies. among the wins was the acquisition of software integration service symphony teleca for $780 million in 2015 to harman, a specialist in audio technologies. now at the helm of saigroup and its three operating companies, wadhwani says he puts in 70-80 hours per week, yet finds time to enjoy listening to music and reading nonfiction books. he handles most calls and meetings from his mansion in the affluent small city los altos. \"i feel like i've achieved a lot but never had the grandiose vision of an elon musk building a trillion-dollar ev business or completely changing space travel,\" wadhwani said. prepping for a possible ipo within two years, symphonyai has recently named three new board members: blythe masters, a british private equity executive and former jpmorgan chase executive; daniela rus, director of the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory; and todd harbaugh, a retired executive vice president at walmart. meanwhile, wadhwani is keeping his eye on the long-range, ethical advancement of ai technology. this past april, he committed $5 million to form the wadhwani center for ai and advanced technologies at research policy organization center for strategic and international studies in washington, d.c. its directive is to \"help frame the right policies for ai governance,\" he said, to \"keep optimistic, but also have guard rails.\""},

network based on open radio access network architecture as the japanese giant looks to boost its loss-making mobile division. hiroshi \"mickey\" mikitani told cnbc that he believes mobile will be \"one of the most profitable businesses\" for rakuten. when asked if rakuten can service its mounting debts, mikitani said: \"of course, no problem at all.\" rakuten and german telco 1&1 on friday launched a mobile network based on a new type of architecture as the japanese giant looks to boost its loss-making mobile division amid mounting debts. the two companies said that it is europe's first \"first fully virtualized 5g network based on the new open ran technology.\" ran stands for radio access network. rakuten provides the technology while 1&1, germany's fourth-largest telecommunication player, will operate the network. 5g refers to next-generation mobile internet that promises super-fast speeds. open ran is a new type of architecture for mobile networks. traditional networks are made up of expensive hardware, such as base stations, usually from one or two providers such as ericsson, nokia or huawei. open ran promises to allow a more diverse set of suppliers for different part of the network. the technology also requires less hardware and runs more on cloud-based software, in theory making it cheaper to operate. rakuten through its mobile division, is providing and integrating the technology that 1&1's network is built on. the 1&1 partnership marks rakuten's first full-scale commercial deployment in europe of its mobile technology. the other one is in its home market of japan, while it also has other trials going on globally. \"i am sure that every single telecom company are now seriously contemplating to deploy open radio access (network), the question is when and how,\" hiroshi \"mickey\" mikitani, ceo of rakuten, told cnbc in an interview that aired monday. mikitani said rakuten will help launch more full-scale commercial open ran networks in 2024, but declined to say how many. he said the number of launches will be \"single digit.\" rakuten is often compared to amazon, with its large japanese e-commerce operation. but it also is strong in financial services. in a bid to add a new business line, rakuten in 2021 launched rakuten symphony, the division leading the open ran charge. but since then, its mobile foray has remained unprofitable and debts have mounted at the company. in the third quarter, revenue in rakuten's mobile unit rose 5% year-on-year to 88.7 billion japanese yen ($615 million). but the company posted losses of 81.2 billion. that is lower than the 117.6 billion loss the division posted in the same period of 2022, sparking hope from the company is moving in the right direction. however, the mobile business has dragged down rakuten group's overall performance with the company posting 13 straight quarters of operating losses as of the september quarter. mikitani told cnbc that he believes mobile will be \"one of the most profitable businesses\" for rakuten. the ceo said the number of net subscribers in its mobile businesses is increasing by 200,000 per month. \"i think it's just a matter of time,\" mikitani said of the mobile businesses path to profitability, although he declined to give a timeline. \"once you overcome the breakeven point, everything will become your gross profit, which is unlike other businesses,\" mikitani said. \"this is going to be hugely profitable. within five years, everybody will say, 'oh my god, that was a genius decision.' because our operating costs are a fraction of our competitors. i don't think they can compete against us because our cost structure is so efficient.\" meanwhile, the company has bonds and borrowings related to its non-financial businesses of 1.7 trillion yen. reuters estimates 800 billion yen of bonds are due to be redeemed by the end of 2025. to service the debt, rakuten has been selling down its stakes in businesses as well as issuing shares to raise money. this week, rakuten announced it would sell shares in rakuten bank, one of its financial services companies, in a move that raised about 60.6 billion yen. this reduced rakuten's stake in rakuten bank from 63.34% to 49.27%. earlier this year, rakuten group issued new shares that raised more than 290 billion yen. when asked if rakuten can service its debt,

($306.6 million) in an investment led by sixth street growth and bain capital tech opportunities. sumup chief financial officer hermione mckee said the fresh capital gives the company \"more firepower to act on opportunities\" including acquisitions and new country launches. sumup confirmed the company is worth more than it was when it raised 590 million euros ($635.3 million) at an 8 billion euro ($8.6 billion) valuation in summer 2022. british payments startup sumup, known for its small card readers, on monday announced it has raised 285 million euros ($306.6 million) in a bumper round of funding that values the company north of $8.6 billion. sixth street growth, the growth arm of global investment firm sixth street, led the investment in sumup, while existing existing investor bain capital tech opportunities, fintech investment firm fin capital, and debt financing firm liquidity group, participated in sumup's latest round as well. the round predominantly consisted of equity, though a small portion of the funds was raised as debt. sumup chief financial officer hermione mckee said the fresh capital gives the company \"more firepower to act on opportunities that we see arising over the course of the next two years.\" \"if we think about our geographical expansion, in august we launched australia as our 36th market globally,\" mckee told cnbc in an interview last week ahead of the news. \"we have this foothold in latin america and there's more expansion that can be done there. then we look at asia, how do we think about that region, and then obviously opportunities across africa. there's so many opportunities globally. we're constantly assessing this 'buy versus build' strategy.\" with this round, the company says it \"continues to build further\" on the valuation it attained in the summer of 2022, when sumup was last valued at 8 billion euros ($8.6 billion) in a 2022 funding round that saw the firm raise a whopping 590 million euros of\u00a0capital for growth and global expansion. a sumup spokesperson confirmed the deal is an up round, meaning its valuation is higher than it was previously. that's no small achievement given the state of european technology valuations, which have taken a hammering over the past year as investors flee from tech due to higher interest rates and macroeconomic headwinds. according to venture data firm pitchbook, median valuations declined in the third quarter across all stages compared to 2022, with late-stage valuations showing the most resilience and growth-stage the least. earlier this year, existing shareholders in sumup sold stakes in the firm at a heavily discounted price to its last official valuation. one, online coupons site groupon, disclosed in a filing with the u.s. securities and exchange commission that it was selling off shares in sumup at a price that would value the company at just 3.9 billion euros ($4.2 billion). sumup, which competes primarily with jack dorsey's payments business block , formerly known as square, as well as paypal's izettle, fis' worldpay, stripe, and adyen , has been expanding into new lines of business lately, not least lending. the company launched a service that enables merchant to apply for a cash advance or business loans up to a certain limit based on their card sales revenues. sumup secured a $100 million credit facility from victory park capital this summer to bolster its cash advance offering. mckee\u00a0said that the lending product has been going well so far, with the vast majority of its merchants paying back in a timely manner. \"we're seeing quick returns on that capital, and merchants that are genuinely supporting their growth. and then they're able to repay that back in a short time periods for the transaction volume that we see,\" mckee said. \"we haven't seen any real pullback in terms of repayment data over the course of the last six months,\" she added. \"our models are constantly iterating to make sure that that those factors we're observing don't become stale.\" sumup also launched new point-of-sale offerings, including self-service kiosks that let customers order in stores using a touchscreen interface. sumup recently launched apple's tap to pay feature in the u.k. and the netherlands, which enables people to tap their card or phone on a vendor's iphone using a smartphone app. it's also been upgrading its existing point-of-sale systems, with its pos lite\u00a0and pos pros countertop systems that can be paired with sumup's card readers. going forward, sumup plans to explore more merger and acquisition opportunities to help it drive its expansion abroad. \"m&a is always something that's on the table,\" mckee said. \"we have expanded into new geographies in the past with m&a. that's something we're always assessing. we have experience in both building an ecosystem as well as buying. and both of these things are available to us, obviously, yes, this just gives us greater optionality and the ability to move quickly, should we see the right opportunity arise.\" sumup has no immediate plans to go public, mckee added, as it has ample access to capital in the private markets. \"i think it's proven by this round that we actually have access to private pools of capital, so we don't need to ipo,\" she said. \"we're constantly improving processes, actually making sure that we are operating at a standard and quality that is appropriate for public markets. but at the same time, this is not something that, you know, is imminent, and

everything about your life.\" a team at google has proposed using artificial intelligence technology to create a \"bird's-eye\" view of users' lives using mobile phone data such as photographs and searches. dubbed \"project ellmann,\" after biographer and literary critic richard david ellmann, the idea would be to use llms like gemini to ingest search results, spot patterns in a user's photos, create a chatbot and \"answer previously impossible questions,\" according to a copy of a presentation viewed by cnbc. ellmann's aim, it states, is to be \"your life story teller.\" it's unclear if the company has plans to produce these capabilities within google photos, or any other product. google photos has more than 1 billion users and 4 trillion photos and videos, according to a company blog post . project ellman is just one of many ways google is proposing to create or improve its products with ai technology. on wednesday, google launched its latest \"most capable\" and advanced ai model yet, gemini, which in some cases outperformed openai's gpt-4. the company is planning to license gemini to a wide range of customers through google cloud for them to use in their own applications. one of gemini's standout features is that it's multimodal, meaning it can process and understand information beyond text, including images, video and audio. a product manager for google photos presented project ellman alongside gemini teams at a recent internal summit, according to documents viewed by cnbc. they wrote that the teams spent the past few months determining that large language models are the ideal tech to make this bird's-eye approach to one's life story a reality. ellmann could pull in context using biographies, previous moments and subsequent photos to describe a user's photos more deeply than \"just pixels with labels and metadata,\" the presentation states. it proposes to be able to identify a series of moments like university years, bay area years and years as a parent. \"we can't answer tough questions or tell good stories without a bird's-eye view of your life,\" one description reads alongside a photo of a small boy playing with a dog in the dirt. \"we trawl through your photos, looking at their tags and locations to identify a meaningful moment,\" a presentation slide reads. \"when we step back and understand your life in its entirety, your overarching story becomes clear.\" the presentation said large language models could infer moments like a user's child's birth. \"this llm can use knowledge from higher in the tree to infer that this is jack's birth, and that he's james and gemma's first and only child.\" \"one of the reasons that an llm is so powerful for this bird's-eye approach, is that it's able to take unstructured context from all different elevations across this tree, and use it to improve how it understands other regions of the tree,\" a slide reads, alongside an illustration of a user's various life \"moments\" and \"chapters.\" presenters gave another example of determining one user had recently been to a class reunion. \"it's exactly 10 years since he graduated and is full of faces not seen in 10 years so it's probably a reunion,\" the team inferred in its presentation. the team also demonstrated \"ellmann chat,\" with the description: \"imagine opening chatgpt but it already knows everything about your life. what would you ask it?\" it displayed a sample chat in which a user asks \"do i have a pet?\" to which it answers that yes, the user has a dog which wore a red raincoat, then offered the dog's name and the names of the two family members it's most often seen with. another example for the chat was a user asking when their siblings last visited. another asked it to list similar towns to where they live because they are thinking of moving. ellmann offered answers to both. ellmann also presented a summary of the user's eating habits, other slides showed. \"you seem to enjoy italian food. there are several photos of pasta dishes, as well as a photo of a pizza.\" it also said that the user seemed to enjoy new food because one of their photos had a menu with a dish it didn't recognize. the technology also determined what products the user was considering purchasing, their interests, work and travel plans based on the user's screenshots, the presentation stated. it also suggested it would be able to know their favorite websites and apps, giving examples google docs, reddit and instagram. a google spokesperson told cnbc: \"google photos has always used ai to help people search their photos and videos, and we're excited about the potential of llms to unlock even more helpful experiences. this was an early internal exploration and, as always, should we decide to roll out new features, we would take the time needed to ensure they were helpful to people, and designed to protect users' privacy and safety as our top priority.\" the proposed project ellmann could help google in the arms race among tech giants to create more personalized life memories. google photos and apple photos have for years served \"memories\" and generated albums based on trends in photos. in november, google announced that with the help of ai, google photos can now group together similar photos and organize screenshots into easy-to-find albums. apple announced in june that its latest software update will include the ability for its photo app to recognize people, dogs and cats in their photos. it already sorts out faces and allows users to search for them by name. apple also announced an upcoming journal app, which will use on-device ai to create personalized suggestions to prompt users to write passages that describe their memories and experiences based on recent photos, locations, music and workouts. but apple, google and other tech giants are still grappling with the complexities of displaying and identifying images appropriately. for instance, apple and google still avoid labeling gorillas after reports in 2015 found the company mislabeling black people as gorillas. a new york times investigation this year found apple and google's android software, which underpins most of the world's smartphones, turned off the ability to visually search for primates for fear of labeling a person as an animal. companies including google, facebook and apple have over time added controls to minimize unwanted memories, but users have reported they sometimes still show up and require the users to toggle through several settings in order to minimize them. don't miss

october, and we reviewed them for you.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/09/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review.html", "author": "jake piazza", "body": "the ray-ban meta smart glasses came out in october, and we reviewed them for you. the camera, audio and calling features were useful and easy to use. the glasses look and feel similar to traditional ray-ban glasses. meta released the second generation of its ray-ban glasses in october. i've been testing them over the last couple of weeks and i really like them, even after factoring in the premium you pay in comparison to regular ray-bans. the $299 headliner model i have feels identical to traditional ray-bans but with more smarts. similar to the first model , they allow you to capture video, snap pictures, place calls through your phone and listen to music. the speakers also are 50% louder, according to meta. there's also a better camera that takes photos in portrait mode instead of landscape, which makes them better suited for social media posts. meta's reality labs unit, which includes its wearable products such as the smart glasses and the meta quest, contributes less than 1% to the company's revenue. even so, its wearables represent meta's attempt at making headway in the devices space in addition to its massive advertising and social media presence. here's what you should know about the ray-ban meta smart glasses. the ray-ban meta glasses are marketed to show that they can be worn every day just like a regular pair of sunglasses. to do that, they need to be as comfortable, stylish and useful as your regular pair. meta and ray-ban nailed that aspect. they're comfortable to wear and aren't clunky. they weigh just a few grams more than regular ray-ban glasses. and, while i was testing out the glasses in the office, i was asked several times why i was wearing sunglasses indoors, so that gives you a gauge of how similar they look to classic ray-bans. they don't look weird. i wore my smart sunglasses without using any of the tech features, and they work just as well as a normal pair of polarized ray-ban sunglasses.  for people who want to replace their corrective lenses, you can get prescription lenses just like you would with the pair you already use. they're convenient if you want to take pictures in the moment without having to reach for your phone. you just press a button on the right side of your glasses or say, \"hey meta, take a photo.\" i liked using them to snap pictures walking around new york city. just check out this side by side of the same tree. the one on the left is taken with my iphone and the one on the right is taken with my glasses. it's easy to import the pictures or videos to the meta view app on a phone, and then you can save them to your camera roll. it's obvious to others when you're taking a photo or video. the circle on the right side of the glasses flashes when you take a photo and it pulses when you're filming, so it would be difficult to take a photo or video without someone noticing. that's an important feature for ray-ban meta glasses to become engrained into mainstream society. people around you know when you're recording. you can't even block the light and take a photo. the glasses will refuse to snap the picture if you try. the audio and calling capabilities are my favorite part, though. you can use the glasses in place of your earbuds. i walked around new york's central park with them while listening to music and prefer the audio experience over earbuds in a setting like this. the sound is still full, but i was more attune to my surroundings, which was helpful when an unleashed dog ran up to me and when a biker sped through a red light. listening to music is sort of like having a soundtrack playing in the background, as opposed to an immersive experience that many new headphones provide.  i'll admit, i don't have airpods with the noise transparency option so it's worth comparing that feature if you have the airpods pro or airpods max. there is definitely more audio leakage with these than i found in my 3rd generation airpods, so i'd probably still go with earbuds on the train if you don't want to bug your fellow passengers. but the glasses were quiet enough that they didn't bother my roommate while i listened to music at home. i liked that i could tap once on the right side of the glasses to pause and resume my music and could slide my finger to adjust the volume. the glasses also work well for phone calls. i made calls with them, both in my room and in noisy areas, and the recipients had no complaints about the audio quality. the conversation on my end was clear and i liked that i could accept incoming calls by double-tapping on the right side. they're easy to charge. the glasses come in a hard shell case that charges the glasses when they are stored. you use a usb-c \u2014 which does not come with the glasses \u2014 to recharge the case, but you get roughly eight charges before you need to do that, which is a big step up from the three additional charges in the previous model. my biggest knock on these glasses is that it's difficult to take pictures if you're wearing a ball cap. this isn't an issue for someone who doesn't wear hats, but it was annoying to have to push my bill slightly up whenever i wanted to snap a photo without the camera getting my hat in it, too. while the glasses let you use voice commands to send messages or ask questions such as \"what's the weather?\" it felt more like a novelty to me and i can't see myself consistently using them. i'm also a big sports fan, and this voice assistant can't tell you the score of the game from last night like other assistants. if you use siri or google assistant on a watch or phone often, then you may find some of the voice commands useful. i just don't use them often. the battery life isn't great if you want to use these as your all-day, every day glasses. they get roughly four hours of battery life for mixed use, which is a combination of all the features the glasses offer, but that can vary depending on how sparingly or not you use them.  my review unit charged from 7% to full in about 50 minutes, which is fast. but if you need to wear them all day with prescription lenses, then you might run into some issues, at least with the full functionality, since you don't really have the option to just take them off and let the glasses charge in the middle of your day. finally, the glasses are water resistant, but not waterproof, so you have to be cautious in rainy weather in a way that you don't have to be with regular glasses. i'd buy them. i really enjoyed the music, headset and photo features of these glasses, and because they still retain the comfort and style of classic ray-bans. normal black ray-ban wayfarer sunglasses cost $171. the meta version of those costs $299. is the ability to snap pictures and videos of your surroundings and use them in place of earbuds and a headset worth the additional money to you? it is for me. don't miss these stories from cnbc pro: saudi arabia is struggling to boost oil prices, raising possibility of supply war with

document appointments you had that day and workouts you completed. the journal app is one example of how apple continues to invest in new iphone features on a yearly basis to protect its iphone franchise from competition from google's android and other phone makers. the iphone is still the most important product apple makes, accounting for $205 billion in sales in its fiscal 2023, or about 52% of the company's overall sales. the more that apple adds features that are used on a daily basis \u2014 such as its credit card, its app store or its imessage service \u2014 the harder it is for most users to switch to a competing phone brand or operating system. the journal app also highlights apple's approach to ai. apple's ai software, such as what's powering the journal app, runs on the device itself, not on a server in the cloud, which has privacy advantages over google's and microsoft's internet-based approach, especially for sensitive information such as health data or travel plans. apple also doesn't highlight ai as a key feature in its marketing \u2014 it prefers the more academic phrase \"machine learning.\" apple's journal app is simple. i've been testing it on a beta version of ios for a month. when you open the app \u2014 you can lock its contents with apple's faceid \u2014 you're brought to a screen with a list of your entries and a single \"+\" button. pressing the plus button lets you start a new entry. at first, it looks like a standard text entry box, like in apple's notes. you can type in some thoughts, add a photo, photos you've taken, an audio recording or drop in an apple maps location of where you've been. the app automatically timestamps the post. after you've added several entries, the front page of the app fills up with your previous entries and you can browse and edit old posts. you can filter your old entries by those that include a photo, an activity or those that are tagged with a certain place. journal entries aren't published anywhere, just stored inside your individual journal app. where the machine learning magic appears is under the magic wand icon, or the \"moments menu.\" when you tap the magic wand icon, it suggests things to write about based on what it knows from your phone, such as the music you were listening to or where you were. for example, when i pressed the moments tab on monday, it suggested i write about a recent vacation \u2014 bringing up a map of where i was, hikes i did while i was on the trip, music i listened to and photos i took when i was there. for one entry, i simply recorded an audio file of the waves crashing, so i could return to the moment later. however, it didn't realize that i had already fully documented that vacation inside the journal app. the journal app's push notifications can also prompt the user. it often sends a push notification when it detects that you've done an activity that you might want to reflect on. for example, i recently had to rush to catch a ferry. my watch noted a walking workout, and i was listening to music at the time. journaling workouts could be very useful for people who are training for marathons or other athletic achievements. the journal app also sent me notifications asking whether i wanted to write about the experience. some days, notifications sent by the app simply ask you to reflect on your day. apple also includes several prompts designed to spur reflection: \"make an audio recording of your surroundings. write about what you notice.\" the app can also be social, suggesting to journal about activities with others when it detects contacts nearby. apple's journal app is basic right now. nothing it does besides suggestions couldn't be done in an old-fashioned paper journal, or even a page inside apple's notes app. but the suggestions and integration with apple's other services set it apart from more low-tech approaches and highlight how apple's integration of hardware and software means that it can learn what's important in your life without collecting your data on its servers. apple is even making its machine learning model that guesses what might be important to the user available to other apps through a programming interface, meaning other apps could benefit from apple's ai. apple needs to continue to improve the journal app to find a place in most people's everyday routines. it would be better if it could automatically fill out more of an entry, especially ones based on photos or other activities. for now, there's no export function, which would enable the journal app to become a more useful place to collect thoughts and ideas that could one day be published. the journal app is available in ios 17.2, which can be downloaded on modern iphones now. here's how to get it: open settings. tap general. choose software update. you may notice some other new features in ios 17.2. the update also includes the ability to change the default alert sound, sticker reactions in imessage and a machine learning feature that blurs photos and other content sent to you that may include nudity. don't miss these stories from cnbc pro: five stocks to buy before the year-end, according to the
