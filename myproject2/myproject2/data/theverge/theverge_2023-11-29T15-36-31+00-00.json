        "body": " it feels like a thousand years since tesla first introduced the cybertruck, but it\u2019s actually only been . still, that\u2019s a long time in the auto world, and to say people are getting antsy waiting would be a huge understatement. the cybertruck certainly took its time getting here, slogging its way through a global pandemic, a presidential election, two ongoing wars, and many other terrible things that have happened over the past four years. tesla ceo elon musk\u2019s acquisition of twitter and his emergence as also took place within this time and is sure to cast a shadow over the cybertruck\u2019s big moment. tesla is facing a much different world than it did in 2019 now, with the first few cybertrucks poised to finally reach a small handful of customers this week, tesla is facing a much different world than it did in 2019 \u2014 a world of , , , and a that tesla was poised to take over the world. musk\u2019s recent scandals have metastasized and folded back over themselves to the point where they\u2019ve become an indecipherable of bad news that . if tesla thinks the cybertruck will help turn things around, it\u2019s probably mistaken. when it was first announced, there were no electric trucks on the market. now, there are at least three\u2026 and more on the way. the cybertruck arrives at a time when , as first adopters give way to bargain-hunters who are coming up empty. experts say what we really need to drive adoption is a mass-market ev that\u2019s affordable and practical. the cybertruck is neither.\u00a0it stands proudly as the antithesis of what the market needs. tesla fans are convinced it will change the industry forever. but it\u2019s been over four years, so let\u2019s revisit the history of the world\u2019s weirdest, and quite possibly hardest to build, truck. , toss on your , and get ready for some cybertruck 101. if you\u2019ve been in a coma for the last four years (and honestly, i envy you), the cybertruck was first introduced at a lavish event in november 2019 at tesla\u2019s design studio in california. it was only the sixth vehicle ever introduced by tesla, and it was supposed to herald the company\u2019s first effort to capture the big-volume, highly lucrative truck market. but musk had no interest in turning the highly successful model 3 into a truck. instead, he wanted something straight out of . the result? angular, dystopian, impractical, and depending on who you ask, kind of goofy-looking. the stainless steel body would emphasize every scratch and fingerprint. the misaligned panels were familiar to anyone who\u2019s owned a tesla. the truck bed couldn\u2019t even hold that much stuff. and \u2026 well, let\u2019s just say it won\u2019t be doing much wiping. going back and reading our coverage of the actual cybertruck reveal is a great reminder of how sometimes the first reaction is the most telling. as our then-transportation reporter sean o\u2019kane wrote (emphasis mine): musk spent months telling everyone that tesla\u2019s first electric pickup truck would look like something out of . and yet, for a brief moment after the truck appeared onstage, the entire room \u2014 one full of tesla customers and fans from all around the world \u2014 fell practically silent in disbelief. it was as if the people in the room were expecting a different kind of magic trick, one where musk would coyly laugh before revealing the true tesla pickup truck, which would still eat ford f-150s for breakfast but look a little less alien. (that feeling only seemed to multiply when tesla chief designer franz von holzhausen broke the truck\u2019s windows while trying to .) still, it\u2019s different, and different can be interesting. you can\u2019t deny that the cybertruck holds a certain appeal, whether as an object of desire or as one of ridicule. people have been flocking to tesla showrooms to see preproduction models. social platforms are teaming with \u201cget a load of this truck\u201d videos. people want selfies with the cybertruck. but do they want the truck itself? spectacle doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into sales. ed niedermeyer, author of , dismissed the cybertruck as a \u201cmeme\u201d vehicle in a recent episode of his podcast, . his co-host alex roy predicted it will be a huge win for tesla. the truth may lie somewhere in the middle. much will depend on tesla\u2019s ability to transform its millions of reservation holders into actual owners. we still don\u2019t know. in 2019, tesla said it would make three versions of the cybertruck: those were the 2019 prices. if the company announces new prices on november 30th, they will most assuredly be higher. the single-motor version, for example, is predicted to retail for over $50,000, while the tri-motor version will likely be over $80,000. tesla has slashed prices on its model 3 and y vehicles this past year, but the cybertruck seems destined for the premium category. and that could . production was originally supposed to start in late 2021. but by august 2021, a delay until 2022 \u2014 and then later to \u201chopefully\u201d 2023. in the meantime, competitors like and have launched their own electric pickups, with ford saying that it plans to make this year. finding a measured opinion on the cybertruck is a bit of a wild goose chase. this is a truck that stirs people\u2019s passions. you either love it or you hate it. there\u2019s no in-between. car designers who spoke to called it \u201ccrude\u201d or \u201ca child\u2019s toy.\u201d others were less charitable. car designer adrian clarke described the cybertruck as \u201ca low polygon joke that only exists in the fever dreams of tesla fans that stands high on the smell of elon musk\u2019s flatulences.\u201d others just ripped on it for being giorgetto giugiaro, the legendary car designer behind the lotus esprit, bmw m1, and most notably, the delorean dmc-12, that he doesn\u2019t want to judge the cybertruck \u201cas beautiful or ugly. it certainly has its admirers who want a vehicle to stand out.\u201d but the panel gaps aside, production-ready versions of the cybertruck aren\u2019t without their defenders. saw a version in a tesla showroom and came away impressed, calling it better than the prototypes that were drawing the most ire and \u201cbadass.\u201d the matte black version that franz von holzhausen drove to a recent malibu cars and coffee event drew the most ire. the panel gaps were especially pronounced, while other aspects appeared slapdash and poorly thought out. car journalist daniel golson, who saw it in person, was flabbergasted in : i\u2019ve been around hundreds of prototype cars in my career, ranging from early test mules to near-production prototypes, and i\u2019ve never seen an automaker proudly present something of this poor quality, especially not this late in development. much has been written about the use of stainless steel for the exterior as the main source of the production delays. steel is incredibly difficult to bend and manipulate, which complicates tesla\u2019s ability to shape it into body panels that line up correctly and don\u2019t result in huge gaps. it\u2019s also nearly impossible to flatten and has a tendency to spring back into its curved form. this is why it\u2019s rarely used in vehicle manufacturing. it\u2019s too tough, too expensive, and too heavy than other, more traditional materials. musk\u2019s demands for an exterior that was also bulletproof drove tesla to seek out thicker steel than what is typically used in the auto industry. this made it more difficult to form, spurring much of the production calamities, . musk himself has been blunt in his characterization of the cybertruck. the truck will be a huge manufacturing challenge for tesla, he said in an internal memo reported by cnbc over the summer. he also said he was worried about \u201cprecision\u201d in manufacturing the truck because its \u201cstraight edges\u201d mean variations show up \u201clike a sore thumb.\u201d \u201cwe dug our own grave with the cybertruck,\u201d musk said . \u201ccybertruck\u2019s one of those special products that comes along only once in a long while. and special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market to reach volume, to be prosperous.\u201d martin viecha, head of tesla investor relations, that tesla is \u201cbetween two major growth waves.\u201d the first wave started with the release of the model 3 in 2017 and continues with the model y in 2020. the next one \u201cwill be driven by the next gen vehicle,\u201d viecha said. the cybertruck doesn\u2019t enter into that calculation because tesla doesn\u2019t expect to make that many, at least not at first. in that \u201cwe dug our own grave\u201d earnings call, musk also said he wanted to \u201ctemper expectations\u201d for the truck, adding the company could face \u201cenormous challenges\u201d in ramping up production and making it cash flow positive. he said that tesla is targeting an annual run rate (the number of vehicles it plans to make in a year) of 250,000 for the cybertruck, but it\u2019s not likely to hit that output until 2025 at the earliest. the cybertruck is set to arrive at an unsettled time for tesla. the company\u2019s once eye-watering sales growth has since leveled off as it deals with stiffer competition in the ev space. some investors are counting on the truck to spark renewed interest in tesla, especially at a time when musk\u2019s online shenanigans are a drag on the brand\u2019s reputation. a successful cybertruck launch \u201cwill prove to the doubters that musk can successfully expand the tesla halo effect as more consumers head down the ev path over the coming years,\u201d said wedbush\u2019s dan ives in a recent research note. not everyone agrees. jefferies analyst philippe houchois said tesla is better off shelving the cybertruck in the interest of getting its number back up. \u201chowever unlikely just a few days before first deliveries, canceling cybertruck would probably be positive for shares,\u201d houchois wrote last week. \u201cwith 2024 already a lost year for growth, it would help tesla refocus on an edge that was built on simplicity, scale and speed.\u201d and morgan stanley\u2019s adam jonas said tesla should focus on new software products that it can license to other automakers, like full self-driving, which is as part of the cybertruck delivery event. i\u2019ve been covering tesla a long time, and i\u2019ve learned never to bet against musk\u2019s ability to pull a rabbit out of his hat. that said, a stainless steel electric truck that upends manufacturing norms and subverts customer expectations about what a truck should look like was always going to be a tall order. there have been bad-looking trucks before. arguably, the current design trend of is extremely shitty \u2014 and not just for the pedestrians who stand a much better chance of being crushed underneath their tires. in the long history of trucks \u2014 from the 1925 model t roadster to today\u2019s hulking, flat-nosed behemoths \u2014 it\u2019s reasonable to assume that we have not seen anything remotely like the tesla cybertruck. no one was asking for it, and yet, this week, 10 people are reportedly slated to receive the first cybertrucks. a big day for all of those who care about the cybertruck. / the verge is a

costs will be reined in, factories will be delayed, and stock buybacks will recirculate cash to shareholders. it\u2019s a crucial moment for gm, which is locked in a tight race with ford, tesla, and others to develop evs and roll out autonomous driving safely and profitably. costs will be reined in, factories will be delayed, and stock buybacks will recirculate cash to shareholders barra said she is \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the slow pace of its ultium battery development, which is supposed to underpin the company\u2019s forthcoming lineup of evs. she is \u201cnot satisfied\u201d with gm\u2019s low stock price. and the cruise \u201cincident,\u201d in which after she was struck in a hit-and-run, is now under independent review, but the robotaxi company will be smaller and slower going forward. \u201cwe will be very transparent with what our go-forward plan is,\u201d barra said. \u201cbut i think there\u2019s been some concern about when that comes.\u201d cruise, in particular, was under the microscope. the company has paused all robotaxi operations in the aftermath of the incident in san francisco in october. two top executives, ceo kyle vogt and chief product officer dan kan, , and the company has said that layoffs will be coming. in the call, gm offered more details on cruise\u2019s uncertain future. the company hired two outside law firms to review cruise\u2019s safety protocols as well as determine whether cruise from the california dmv of its driverless vehicle dragging the hit-and-run victim to the side of the road. the company issued a voluntary earlier this month to update the software to prevent similar incidents in the future. gm has lost $8.2 billion on cruise since 2017 but expects to lose much less going forward. the automaker didn\u2019t share specific cash reductions, but chief financial officer paul jacobson said it would likely amount to \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars. \u201cwe are projecting to have a little bit of a narrower scope as we focus in on safety and scaling up in a much narrower view,\u201d jacobson said. but unlike some of its competitors, gm is not pulling out completely from the autonomous vehicle business. \u201cwe\u2019re going to be very deliberate about how we go forward,\u201d barra said, adding that when cruise restarts its operations, it will be in only one city. the company also will need to \u201cbuild trust\u201d with local leaders and first responders, barra said, in a nod to complaints from san francisco officials that cruise\u2019s vehicles obstructed city operations. \u201cthere\u2019s been a lot of uncertainty in our industry and frankly, we didn\u2019t execute well this year\u201d on the ultium battery delays, barra was blunt in her assessment. \u201cthere\u2019s been a lot of uncertainty in our industry and frankly, we didn\u2019t execute well this year, as it relates to demonstrating our ev capability and the capability of ultium because of the module manufacturing automation equipment issues that we had,\u201d she said. \u201cso i\u2019m disappointed in that. i think that has created some concern.\u201d recently, gm said it would delay production of its upcoming slate of electric pickup trucks at its plant in michigan\u2019s orion township by\u00a0\u201ca few months.\u201d barra assured investors that the issues with ultium manufacturing were being resolved. \u201cour module production issue is not really related to ultium,\u201d she added. \u201cas i\u2019ve said before, it is really an automation manufacturing issue.\u201d barra said that while ev growth has slowed, demand is still heading in the right direction, noting that us car buyers were on track to purchase 1 million evs this year for the first time. \u201cthere\u2019s really no reason that ev demand won\u2019t be higher in the years ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cconsideration is rising, the policy environment is favorable. the public charging infrastructure is growing and customer choice is expanding.\u201d she also acknowledged that the recent contracts with the united auto workers union are spooking investors because of their associated costs. gm estimates that the new contracts will result in added labor costs of around $500 per vehicle in 2024 and $575 on average over the life of the contract. the company also expects to raise battery costs by about $3 per kilowatt-hour, but it still expects to achieve \u201cmid-single digit profitability\u201d on its ev business by 2025. gm expects to reduce net costs by $2 billion through 2024, which includes lower salaries, lowering marketing expenses, and additional overhead reductions. and tellingly, barra also managed to slip in some praise for the company\u2019s internal combustion engine vehicles, which continue to generate profits for the company at a time when costs are rising across the board. \u201cour strong ice business that frankly has gotten stronger, and we still believe there\u2019s growth there,\u201d barra said. gm has said it expects to . / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"
