well, i\u2019ve been using it for my personal notes for years. while i feel that it\u2019s become way too overblown and, more importantly, too expensive, i haven\u2019t been able to motivate myself to pull my decade of data out of there. at this point, though, i\u2019m not sure i\u2019d recommend it to a new user \u2014 especially now that it\u2019s even more than it used to. however, in the end, the app you use depends on your personal needs. here are more details on our top picks in this category. bear markdown notes is an app for macos and ios devices with an excellent interface and selection of features that could make me regret my faithfulness to android. even the free version offers a number of tweaks \u2014 for example, the header can either be the first sentence of the note or the date and time (or you can leave it empty and put in anything you want). you have a wide choice of fonts and various formatting options. the app uses tags in order to organize its notes; you create a tag for a note by starting your chosen word with a pound sign (or surrounding a phrase with them). the word / phrase will then appear in the left-hand column, where you can click on it to find all the tagged notes. besides the column on the left, you have a second column that shows all the notes in the highlighted section, while the main window shows what is in the chosen note itself. it\u2019s a ui that is used by several apps, including evernote. you can format your notes in a variety of ways by clicking a biu (bold / italics / underline) icon at the top right of each note; you can also create subheads, bulleted and to-do lists, tables, links, and add attachments.\u00a0another icon lets you see the statistics for the note \u2014 number of words, characters, and when it was modified. you can also see an outline of your various heads, subheads, and any backlinks. in other words, even in the free version, there are plenty of ways you can play with bear notes. on the other hand, if you want to sync your notes across devices, you\u2019ll have to upgrade to the pro version. with that, you also get password protection, the ability to search inside attachments, more formats, and the ability to export notes as pdfs, epub, and other formats (the free version lets you export in markdown, txt, and rtf). free version available. pro version costs $2.99 a month or $29.99 a year with a 7-day free trial. evernote started out in 2008 as an innovative and well-regarded note-taking app. over the years, however, its reputation has suffered as it worked through , , and an interface that can feel bloated and feature-heavy. it is now owned by app developer bending spoons and has moved its operations to europe ( in the process). and as of december 2023, , making it essentially unusable for most users except as a trial version. that being said, the paid version of evernote still does what it does well, especially if you\u2019re one of those users who has stuck with it for a while. the basic look and feel of the web app hasn\u2019t changed much, although the homepage now shows recent notes, a scratch pad, and recently captured websites. (the homepage can be personalized with other widgets if you have a paid account.) there are several ways to organize your notes: they can be tagged and / or assigned to folders, and folders can be grouped into named \u201cstacks.\u201d\u00a0you can create to-do notes. you can search within all your notes, clip webpages in a variety of ways, and sync up to two devices. you can upload up to 60mb of data a month with a maximum note size of 25mb. and evernote has been adding ai features such as , currently in beta, which uses ai to \u201ctidy up\u201d your notes. in other words, evernote has become a fairly complex product, although, as mentioned before, you\u2019ll want to look at the paid versions to use it properly. the personal plan lets you sync an unlimited number of devices, upload up to 10gb of data a month with a maximum note size of 200mb, connect a gmail account, and more; the professional plan adds additional app integration and a variety of other features. limited free version available. personal plan costs $14.99 a month or $129.99 a year. professional plan costs $17.99 a month or $169.99 a year. google keep started out as a fairly simple note-taking app, and while it has added a few features since it began, it\u2019s still a good, straightforward way to record your thoughts. because it is so interconnected with other google apps (for example, you can access it directly from google calendar, and you can convert a keep note to a google doc), it works especially well if you\u2019re invested in the google ecosystem. keep isn\u2019t quite as sparse as it used to be: you can create new notes with instant lists, drawings, or images; you can also add collaborators and a variety of backgrounds. in addition, there have been that have been promised, such as text formatting\u00a0(although as of this writing, they were still rolling out). meanwhile, being google, the search ain\u2019t bad. free. joplin is an open-source app that, on first glance, looks like a somewhat simpler version of evernote. it has the list of folders (also known as notebooks) on the far left, a column listing the contents of the folder to the right of that, and then a space to show the contents of the highlighted entry. a major difference, though, is that joplin produces straightforward markdown files (as opposed to evernote\u2019s proprietary .enex format), and there is actually a toggle that lets you see each file in markdown or, if you prefer, rich text. which is handy, especially if you like to look at code; my only problem is that links are not live in the rich text format \u2014 although there is probably a way to tweak that. and that is a second interesting thing about joplin: if you want to be able to personalize your app, you can. there are a variety of plugins, and you can even create your own scripts and plugins using the extension api. if, on the other hand, you\u2019re not comfortable with coding and apis, joplin\u2019s existing extensions should provide you with plenty to work with. you just may need to consult its lively user forum. in order to synchronize joplin among your devices, you need to set it up with one of several existing cloud services (such as dropbox or onedrive). you can also use for-pay , which offers additional storage and other features. cost: free. joplin cloud starts at \u20ac2.99 ($3.27) a month or \u20ac28.69 ($31.36) a year. if there\u2019s one way to describe notion, it would be ambitious. you can start with several different types of formats \u2014 a table, a board, a timeline, a calendar, a list, a created template \u2014 or just an empty page. if you\u2019re an individual, you can create an unlimited number of pages, share your data with a number of apps, including slack and github, and share your content with up to ten \u201cguests\u201d for free. in fact, for most people, free will be quite sufficient. there are some limitations \u2014 for example, file uploads are limited to 5mb \u2014 but not enough to really count. a pro version adds unlimited uploads and some additional group features. like evernote and other higher-end apps, notion organizes its notes into folders \u2014 except in this case, each note can act as a folder and can contain other notes, which can contain other notes. notion also seems to be constantly adding new features, such as ai writing capabilities and new types of sharing options. in fact, its lack of limitations may be a problem for some users. if you like to really get into the workings of a complex app and screw around with it until it does everything you want it to do \u2014 and then some \u2014 then you may want to check out notion and play a bit with its features. (for example, i currently use notion to track my various workflows and upcoming tasks.) however, if all you want to do is just write down your thoughts with maybe a few extra options, you might want to go with something a bit simpler. free version available. plus version costs $10 a month or $96 a year. the venn diagram of evernote users and onenote users seldom overlaps. this despite all they have in common: both have wide ranges of useful features, and each seems to add new functionality every couple of months or so. but the feel of each is different. in onenote, each entry is a page, and each page can contain a variety of different media, including text, audio, images, video, tables, and drawings, among others. pages are organized into sections, and sections into notebooks. there are a lot of ways you can tweak your data, how it is organized, and how it looks. you can create to-do lists and reminders, mark text as important, and change the look of the text. you can highlight and make a variety of drawings in a variety of colors. if you use other microsoft apps such as outlook, you can sync your onenote entries with them \u2014 for example, to keep track of outlook meetings. you can change the page color and style, or switch from dark to light. in fact, like evernote, onenote has had so many different abilities added that it can become a bit overwhelming. for example, when i wanted to find out whether i could extract text from a photo, i went to onenote\u2019s \u201ctell me\u201d icon, which, if it can\u2019t find an immediate answer to your question, offers a smart lookup link. when \u201cextract text\u201d didn\u2019t come up with anything, i clicked it and was offered (via a side column) a wikipedia definition of a text file and links to several third-party apps. (a simple \u201cwe don\u2019t do that\u201d would have been nice.) one thing about onenote that gives it an advantage over evernote: it is still completely free. so if you\u2019re looking for alternatives, it\u2019s worth giving onenote a try. free. i\u2019d be remiss if i didn\u2019t include apple notes in this list, mainly because it is an excellent alternative for those who can use it \u2014 unsurprisingly, those with apple devices. notes is apple\u2019s version of google keep (or keep is google\u2019s version of apple notes). it\u2019s a built-in, simple way to take notes, save photos, scan documents, and make sketches. you can organize your notes into folders, create tags using hash signs, and create \u201csmart folders\u201d that will automatically collect notes that will match a variety of options, including tags, mentions, or types of notes, among others. using icloud, it syncs the content to an impressive extent \u2014 for example, you can make a sketch on an ipad and it will immediately appear in a note, or you can scan a business card with your iphone, and then, from notes, add the phone number to your contact list or go to the listed website. notes is an excellent resource for those who are in the apple ecosystem and who want a solid, simple-to-use note-taking app. free. if there ever was an honest name for an app, this is it. simplenote is exactly that: it offers straightforward note-taking for anyone who just wants to, well, take notes. it doesn\u2019t do anything but text (although it does have an audio feature that will read you what\u2019s on the page), and it doesn\u2019t offer any organizational options other than tags (which are listed for you on the left side of the app). it does let you create checklists, but not much more than that. however, simplenote must be fulfilling some people\u2019s needs, because it has been around a while. (in fact, when i installed it, i found some existing notes: i had apparently used it in 2010 to keep quick notes during a ces trade show.) , it was originally developed in 2008 and went completely open source in 2016. simplenote is simple, easy, and works on all major platforms (including linux). you want to just take text-based notes? this may be for you. free. some apps are popular, some are very popular \u2014 and some actually have . obsidian is one of the latter. this app is the kind of thing that, if you\u2019re into it, will have you exploring its various ins, outs, and add-ons for days and weeks on end. obsidian uses the format for its notes (which means they can be used on a variety of other apps). your notes and other media are kept locally in a vault (in other words, a main folder). there are ways to sync between devices for free \u2014 \u2014 or you can pay a few dollars a month to use . as you can imagine, something this flexible is hard to describe. even at the beginning, there are several interesting formats that you don\u2019t get in most other note-taking software. when you first open it after installation, you get several choices on the left side of the page: a graph view, a canvas view (which lets you create a flow chart, pinboard, or other arrangement), and one of my current favorites, a daily note (which is simply a dated note but is a nice idea if you want to keep a journal). you can also create templates. and none of this takes into account that have been created by its community \u2014 there were 1,233 when last i checked. of course, this means that if you want to really take advantage of obsidian, you have to invest some time and effort. but for those into tweaking their apps to suit them completely, it will probably be worth it. free. obsidian sync costs $8 a month. zoho notebook is one of the best-looking apps in this roundup. it organizes your notes by dividing them up into separate notebooks; each notebook can contain notes, audio files, photos, or other attachments. you can also have to-do lists and share your notebooks with others. you can play with the typeface, have different background colors, insert tables, and set reminders.\u00a0recently, it added the ability to share notebooks and use a noteboard format. as a sort of extra, each notebook has a colorful cover: you can choose from a free gallery, pull in a photo or other graphic file from your computer, or select additional graphics if you choose to be a premium member. the ability to add larger files, access histories of your notes, and use smart tags, among other features. interestingly, zoho is one of the least known long-term office suites around. its first product, zoho writer, was introduced in 2005, and it has been steadily adding more apps since then. (and occasionally removing them; one app, zoho docs, was discontinued last year using a rather awkward migration process.) and while most of zoho\u2019s apps are focused on small- and medium-sized businesses, some of its longer-term apps, such as zoho notebook, are still very good for individuals and worth checking out. free version available. pro version costs $1.99 a month or $19.99 a year. / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"},

(though, frankly, 30 hours is still miles ahead of any current sony controller out there.) it maintains the cadre of turtle beach\u2019s software features found in its lower-cost and controllers: various eq presets for tweaking headset game audio, superhuman hearing to get a better bead on enemy footsteps while using a 3.5mm wired headset, and pro-aim for quickly cranking down stick sensitivity while trying to pick off some accurate sniper shots. where the stealth ultra really sets itself apart are its hall effect sticks and that bonkers screen jammed into the middle. hall effect sticks are a welcome addition to this premium controller segment, as equally pricey gamepads from both and can suffer from stick drift over time, but the stealth ultra\u2019s screen offers an intriguing novelty for connectivity and settings. while you may think it\u2019s a touchscreen, it isn\u2019t. the on-screen controls of the 1.5-inch display can only be tinkered with by hitting that plus button on the bottom of the controller\u2019s face, disconnecting your inputs from the game and dialing in what you see on the screen. what can you control on the tiny screen? well, for starters, all of turtle beach\u2019s audio customizations, rgb lighting effects, and up to 10 user-customizable controller profiles. that actually sounds much better than other turtle beach controllers, which have a cluster of somewhat confusing buttons to toggle many of those settings. the other use for the stealth ultra\u2019s screen is getting phone notifications mirrored to your gamepad directly from ios or android. android phone notifications require you to install turtle beach\u2019s control center 2 app, which can also be used to dial in the same settings found on the stealth ultra\u2019s built-in screen. i don\u2019t know if having mobile notifications popping up between my thumbs during a game is any less distracting than keeping them confined to my phone screen, but perhaps turtle beach is onto something with a second screen-ish experience here. at the very least, it\u2019s good for quickly toggling advanced settings without having to exit to your console\u2019s dashboard or open up another app on your pc. i\u2019ll have to see how it works out once i get some hands-on time, and see how the stealth ultra stacks up to . / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"},

interviews, and trailers. jul 17 the year is 1997, and famed studio ghibli director hayao miyazaki , a film that set new records at the box office for japanese animation and revolutionized the medium. the year is 2001, and miyazaki announced plans to retire following the release of saying he can no longer work on feature-length animated films. the year is 2013, and miyazaki announced plans to retire following the release of , \u201cif i said i wanted to [make another feature film], i would sound like an old man saying something foolish.\u201d the year is 2023, and miyazaki is an old man saying something foolish by releasing a new film, titled in japan and for the international market. nov 22 takeshi honda already had a good gig lined up. the veteran animator was slated to work on , the next film in the sci-fi series that honda had worked on in fits and starts over the last two decades. before starting that job, he partnered with studio ghibli\u2019s famed hayao miyazaki on , a short film that aired exclusively at the ghibli museum. but as was winding down, miyazaki came to honda with a proposition: be the supervising animator on his next feature film. \u201cof course i had already booked so i had to say to him \u2018i need some time to talk with the other parties, and come to a decision.\u2019 i had to stall,\u201d honda said. \u201cbut miyazaki was in quite a rush and was very loud about this. he said \u2018i don\u2019t have any more time. nobody in the miyazaki family has lived beyond 80. this is probably going to be my last film so you have to come on board.\u2019 and when miyazaki says that to you, really there\u2019s no way to say no.\u201d nov 2 in the months before \u2019s japanese debut, studio ghibli made a point of keeping details about the latest animated feature from hayao miyazaki to a minimum. for those who\u2019ve been trying to avoid spoilers, it\u2019s definitely gotten trickier what with all the buzz coming from its run on the film festival circuit. but as much as you might expect the trailer for to give away, it\u2019s a surprisingly restrained and tantalizing look at just . it\u2019s difficult to parse where and when \u2019s young protagonist mahito (luca padovan) is in the movie\u2019s new trailer, but it is clear that all of the odd and inexplicable occurrences around him have something to do with a strange talking grey heron (robert pattinson) that seems to know something about his mother. as confused about his own dreams in which his mother calls out for help, he\u2019s even more alarmed at the heron\u2019s awareness of what\u2019s going on in his head and insistence that mahito must follow him to a magical world. oct 17 when studio ghibli\u2019s finally hits north american theaters, it\u2019ll be doing so with some star power. distributor gkids announced the english voice cast for the animated feature, , and it includes some big names: christian bale, dave bautista, gemma chan, willem dafoe, karen fukuhara, mark hamill, robert pattinson, and florence pugh. the news came alongside a new poster for the film: sep 8 , hayao miyazaki\u2019s first feature film in a decade, probably won\u2019t be his last after all. studio ghibli executive junichi nishioka told cbc news that not only does he not feel like retiring anymore, he\u2019s to create yet another film.

the most secretive films of the year just got a little less mysterious with the first trailer for . the latest film from studio ghibli and perhaps the final feature-length project from famed director hayao miyazaki, premiered in japan in july. in the lead-up to its debut, ghibli was refreshingly vague in discussing the film, which is also known as (and based on genzaburo yoshino\u2019s novel of

it\u2019s going to overrun the internet with generated crap! it can write code! it will write malware that ruins everything! it can make pixar movies! it\u2019s going to be stuck in the uncanny valley forever! you\u2019ll never have a job again! you\u2019ll never a job again! ai will save us! ai will kill us! it\u2019s worth pausing here for just a second to point out that, in reality, most of this technology is still not very good. large language models \u201challucinate,\u201d which is a nice way of saying they make stuff up, all the time. if you look at an ai image for more than about two seconds, you can always tell it was generated. the emails it writes for you always have that machine-made vibe to them. ai systems are not smarter than humans, or more creative, or really anything. is it remarkable that they\u2019re as good as they are? sure! but ai so far is shaping up like self-driving cars \u2014 it got pretty good faster than anybody thought, and it\u2019s going to be a hell of a lot of work to get good enough to be everywhere. there is absolutely no reason, right now, to think that we\u2019re going to hit some kind of superhuman artificial general intelligence anytime soon. if ever. this is the point where \u201cnobody saw this coming\u201d gets complicated, though. ai may not be finished yet, but it\u2019s already better than most people expected. and even in recent weeks, openai by the speed with which chatgpt has grown and openai has moved to monetize it with . ceo sam altman was , for reasons we still don\u2019t exactly know: was it a power play between board members and executives, the result of a disagreement over safety, or something else entirely? 2023 has forced everyone to play catch up on what it all means that drama was strange and high-stakes and ultimately maybe not related to the broader question. so let\u2019s get back to that broader question: ? because this has all happened so fast, and because the effects of ai are so potentially wide-ranging, 2023 has forced everyone to play catch up on what it all means. openai\u2019s original mission statement was to \u201cadvance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\u201d which is vague, but seems good! it\u2019s also easy to say when there\u2019s no financial return, and much harder when analysts estimate your total addressable market is . across tech, and around the world, lots of folks are pondering this same tension. if you\u2019re google ceo sundar pichai, and you\u2019ve now spent unironically that ai is \u201cmore profound than electricity or fire,\u201d is your responsibility to maximize its value for shareholders or for humanity? there\u2019s not a lot of evidence that shows you can do both at once, and historically speaking, shareholders tend to win. if ai is going to change everything \u2014\u00a0like, literally everything \u2014\u00a0can it do so inside the tech industry and economy we know? is the ai we need the same thing as the ai that makes the most money? is your responsibility to maximize ai\u2019s value for shareholders or for humanity? we definitely seem to like being able to more quickly write business emails, and we like being able to ask excel to \u201cmake this into a bar graph\u201d instead of hunting through menus. we like being able to code just by telling chatgpt what we want our app to do. but do we want seo-optimized, ai-generated news stories to take over publications we used to love? do we want ai bots that act like real-life characters and become anthropomorphized companions in our lives? should we think of ai more as a tool or a collaborator? if an ai tool can be trained to create the exact song / movie / image / story i want right now, is that art or is that dystopia? even as we start to answer those questions, ai tech seems to always stay one step and one cultural revolution ahead. at the same time, there have been of stealing artists\u2019 work, to which multiple us judges have said, essentially: our existing copyright laws just don\u2019t know what to do with ai at all. lawmakers have wrung their hands about ai safety, and president joe biden signed a fairly generic executive order that instructed agencies to create safety standards and companies to do good and not evil. there\u2019s a case to be made that the ai revolution was built on immoral and / or illegal grounds, and yet the creators of these models and companies continue to confidently go ahead with their plans, while saying it\u2019s both impossible and anti-progress to stop them or slow them down. this all gets really heady really fast, i know. and the truth is, nobody knows where all this will be even 12 months from now, especially not the people making the loudest predictions. all you have to do is look at recent hype cycles \u2014 the blockchain, the metaverse, and many others \u2014 for evidence that things don\u2019t usually turn out the way we think. but there\u2019s so much momentum behind the ai revolution, and so many companies deeply invested in its future, that it\u2019s hard to imagine gpts going the way of nfts. if anything, the next 12 months of the ai industry will move even faster than the last 12. openai\u2019s tech has improved drastically since that first chatgpt launch, as has its competitors\u2019. and the whole industry has had a year to think about all the places ai might be useful in our lives and profitable in their products. there will be new companies building ai chips, ai data centers, and the rest of the massive infrastructure required to make an llm work at speed and at scale. we\u2019re going to get a slew of ai-centric gadgets, like the humane ai pin, as companies try to figure out if chatbots can push us to the post-smartphone era.
