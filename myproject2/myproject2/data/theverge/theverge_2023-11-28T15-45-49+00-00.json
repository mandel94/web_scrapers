it claims to use significantly less energy than its competitors. running machines that suck co2 out of the or tends to , an issue that drives up costs and can even limit how much good they do for the climate without access to ample clean energy sources. graphyte has a , which it calls carbon casting. essentially, it\u2019s a way to  mummify plant matter \u2014 preventing it from decaying, which would otherwise release carbon dioxide that the plants absorbed when they were alive through photosynthesis. the company starts by collecting biomass, which, in this case, is waste from agriculture and timber production. then it dries the plant material, preventing decomposition by getting rid of any moisture and microbes. after that, the biomass gets tightly packed into bricks and wrapped in what graphyte says is \u201can environmentally-safe, impermeable barrier to ensure that decomposition does not restart.\u201d bury those bricks underground, and graphyte says it can store the carbon dioxide those plants took in during their lifetime for a thousand years. the first commercial deployment of this method for american airlines will take place at graphyte\u2019s facility in pine bluff, arkansas. the company also has financial backing from gates\u2019 climate investment firm, breakthrough energy ventures. the is for graphyte to capture and store 10,000 tons of carbon for american airlines by 2025, with carbon removal credits issued to represent each ton of carbon removed. those credits resemble similar carbon offsets tied to forests or tree planting schemes, programs that have been to result in real-world reductions in greenhouse gas pollution. emerging credit markets for methods to remove co2, like carbon casting, will have to prove that they can get their accounting right. in other words, they\u2019ll have to show that new projects actually permanently trap co2 that otherwise would have wound up in the atmosphere. moreover, it doesn\u2019t do any good for a company to rely entirely on capturing carbon dioxide to fight climate change. even at $100 a ton, it gets to try to capture or offset tens of millions of tons of co2 pollution each year. and the is clear that tactics like carbon removal are only a supplement to the real cure for climate change: preventing the pollution in the first place by dropping fossil fuels and turning to clean energy. for its part, american airlines is also working on transitioning to sustainable aviation fuels and even reducing airplane that exacerbate global warming. / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"},

which is still discounted from cyber monday. a 46-piece screwdriver kit that can help you repair practically any tech device out there. i own at least two of these little , and i frequently buy them for friends and family, too. for an average price of $35, you get a screwdriver with nearly every bit you\u2019d need for most gadgets (including the weird ones for apple products), a plastic and a metal spudger, tweezers, and a suction cup. i\u2019ve replaced batteries in iphones with this kit. i\u2019ve built entire pcs with this kit. i\u2019ve swapped out backplates on steam decks and housings of joy-con controllers with one of these kits. i\u2019ve even used it to repair my eyeglasses. one of the best parts of the kit is it all goes in a single case that can be tossed in a computer bag or purse or be left in a desk drawer at the office. but honestly, the main reason i love it is the selection and quality of the bits. too often, precision screwdrivers have super soft bits that strip the first time you use them with a screw that\u2019s been tightened by a machine. given that most gadgets have at least one too-tight screw, i\u2019ve gone through quite a few cheap screwdriver kits before i settled on this one. while i\u2019m slowly building out a high-quality selection of precision screwdrivers, most people don\u2019t have that luxury or necessity. this is a great alternative \u2014 plus, you feel like kind of a badass when someone asks you to help fix a gadget, and you just pull this kit out of your bag in the middle of starbucks and get to work. a cutting tool with a ceramic blade that\u2019s quick, easy, and safe. i admit tiktok made me buy this , but it\u2019s been indispensable to someone who may or may not have an online shopping addiction. the slice micro ceramic blade safety cutter\u2019s tiny blade cuts through paper packaging tape cleanly, opens plastic wrapping, and keeps me from going insane opening blister packaging. it doesn\u2019t damage whatever is inside, which unfortunately happens very often with my regular metal box cutter. the downside is that it\u2019s so small you may lose track of it if not in use, but it does have a built-in magnet and a handy dandy hole for a keyring. and while it doesn\u2019t fully slice through a cardboard box, it will still leave a scratch, although that could ultimately damage the ceramic blade if not used properly. i\u2019ve had my slice micro for a few months, so i\u2019m not worried about it dulling yet, but it is unclear if the blade is replaceable. an under-desk dual headphone hanger that uses 3m adhesive for mounting and an included velcro strap to anchor a headphone cable. i gave this a try for one of our , and it has not disappointed me yet. i use it to hold my and some extra cords. it\u2019s small enough to remain out of the way but large enough to hold more than the headset itself. it has a pretty strong hold and doesn\u2019t give, even as i raise my standing desk up and down several times a day. it\u2019s not the prettiest accessory one can attach to their desk, but it is highly functional. charge your iphone, apple watch, and airpods all at once with this three-in-one charging dock. i got this as a birthday present from my partner after several months of arguing over our sleeping arrangements. something about me trailing the charging cables for my devices in the bed being \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cextremely uncomfortable.\u201d anyway, after begrudgingly acknowledging my poor charging habits, i have to admit that having this on my desk has had benefits outside of not garroting myself mid-slumber. my iphone, apple watch, and wireless earbuds rarely run out of juice, as i no longer fall asleep before plugging them in. i\u2019ve also taken to using the charger\u2019s upright positioning for phones to my advantage \u2014 serving as a desk clock, a tiny display for slack or discord, and as a hub to remotely control the various smart devices around my home. it helps me separate the device from being my phone and instead helps me build the habit of it being another tool to boost my productivity. a 5.5-cup-capacity rice cooker and warmer that not only cooks rice but also comes with a steaming basket to double as a steamer and a cake menu setting to bake cakes. a lot of people will tell you that rice cookers are single-use appliances meant only for rice \u2014 they\u2019re wrong. a rice cooker is at cooking rice, but it can do a lot of the same things as an instant pot. for instance, you can use it to cook hardboiled eggs or oatmeal, steam vegetables, make porridge, make one-pot meals, and even bake a cake. i grew up with giant 10-cup rice cookers at home, but i didn\u2019t appreciate how versatile this appliance was until i left the country for college. a tiny two-cup rice cooker kept me fed in my cramped 250-square-foot tokyo apartment. it was programmable, so i could wash my rice, stick it in the cooker, and know that when i woke up late for class, i could still whip up some or oatmeal for a quick, cheap, and nutritious breakfast. (it also took the hassle out of steel-cut oats.) whenever i had a craving for sweets, it was so easy to take pancake mix and for one. i\u2019ve since graduated to a 5.5-cup , and it\u2019s one of the handiest tools i have for meal prepping. when i was sick this past winter, i made ample use of its porridge setting to make a congee-type dish with chicken and ginger \u2014 just like my mom used to make when i was a kid. the fact that it\u2019ll keep something warm for , meant i could crawl out of bed, scoop out some porridge, and crawl back into bed with minimal effort. when i\u2019m feeling lazy, i throw eggs in there, and bam \u2014 some extra hard-boiled protein. mine also comes with a little basket, so it\u2019s super easy to throw in veggies or steam frozen dumplings. but what i like most is that rice cookers are more space-efficient than instant pots. in my kitchen, the spot where i could fit an instant pot is instead occupied by a rice cooker, blender, and spoon rest. a multitasking kitchen gadget that doesn\u2019t take over your entire counter? that\u2019s a must if you live in a small space. a solid, basic toaster oven that fits four slices of toast or a nine-inch pizza. i love a toaster oven! it\u2019s compact, works fast, and is perfect for reheating pizza, making nachos, and yes, even toast. i use my toaster oven more than my regular oven for sure \u2014 and probably more than any other item in my kitchen. i have a pretty basic model like , but these days, many come with other features, like air frying and convection oven capabilities. keep food fresh by squeezing all the air out of the package and sealing it for long- or short-term storage. i never knew how much i needed a vacuum sealer until i actually got one. i\u2019m the type of person who shops at wholesale clubs despite only needing food for two people, so when i buy meat, i get of it all at once, some of which inevitably gets stored in my fridge or freezer. that\u2019s where my vacuum sealer comes in. while i can\u2019t speak to the quality of other vacuum sealers, the is awesome. not only does the thing help keep raw meat and other food fresher for longer in the fridge, but it also helps save space in the freezer (each package of meat becomes much flatter when all the air is sucked out of it). with this little machine, i can load up whatever i want in one of the foodsaver bags, insert the open end into the machine, which vacuums up all the air and then closes the bag using its heat sealing feature in one fell swoop. it\u2019s pretty neat! expandable backpack that comes with a lot of storage space and packing cubes. earlier this year, i committed to traveling more, and so i took a look at the gear i had that could be replaced after years of trekking the globe. my ratty old secondhand carry-on bag was the first thing to be replaced. after several days of weighing the pros and cons of various travel bags, i stumbled upon this on amazon, and it fit all of my needs. it can carry a laptop, several days\u2019 worth of clothes, my , and more. the bag even includes some packing cubes. it\u2019s very comfortable, and the weight is well distributed when it\u2019s completely full. it\u2019s an inexpensive alternative to many name-brand carry-on bags, too. so far, i\u2019ve used it on a handful of trips, and the quality has held up. it also holds onto pet fur, though, so i had to add a small lint roller to my travel necessities. but that\u2019s just life while traveling with a dog anyway. this all-in-one 20w usb-c power cube boasts three ac outlets, two usb-a ports, and one usb-c port. nobody wants to carry a power strip or an extension cord with them on their vacation. it\u2019s probably unnecessary if you\u2019re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you\u2019re camping. but sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it\u2019s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there\u2019s already two lamps plugged into it. older buildings especially suffer from what i can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different usb and usb-c charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they\u2019re too heavy. after one (totally pleasant) vacation where i had to charge my phone, watch, airpods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, i bought this . it\u2019s not a full power strip \u2014\u00a0just a cube with a few sockets along with usb and usb-c charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. i\u2019ve brought it on a few trips since then. it takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase. the three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. this is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. there are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people\u2019s devices. if you\u2019re traveling overseas, don\u2019t forget to purchase a different plug type for the region you\u2019re going to or pack an adapter. the sonos roam is a truly portable sonos speaker with a rugged design that\u2019s built to withstand the elements. it also features wireless charging and supports airplay 2, alexa, and google assistant. for the longest time, my go-to portable speaker for camping and backpacking was the . it was small and efficient, but it didn\u2019t mesh well with the rest of my audio setup, especially on those sweltering summer days when i barely made it beyond the confines of my own backyard. a couple of years ago, however, i splurged on the . the rugged, pint-sized device is on the pricier side when compared to other bluetooth speakers, but it produces solid sound for the size, offers wireless charging, and can automatically jump between my home wi-fi network and bluetooth, a convenience i\u2019ve come to appreciate when strapping the speaker to my bike and heading out the door. and while i might not be able to fire off my usual quips at alexa when i take it into the backcountry \u2014 the roam only supports voice commands when connected to wi-fi \u2014 i certainly can still do it poolside with a drink in hand. epicka\u2019s universal travel adapter is an all-in-one adapter that includes four different plugs that cover over 150 countries. in my youth, i forgot to pack plug adapters for international trips one too many times. buying them once you\u2019ve landed in another country isn\u2019t always easy, either. and if you\u2019re like me, your relatives in rural korea don\u2019t always have more than one plug for your american devices \u2014 in which case, you\u2019ll have to share with your six other cousins. nope. absolutely not. which is why i never leave this country without a universal travel adapter. basically, it\u2019s six plug adaptors in one. depending on which one you get, it might come with usb ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. granted, it\u2019s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you\u2019ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it\u2019s a game-changer. what i like about is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage. the only caveat is that, although it says \u201cuniversal,\u201d it\u2019s technically only the four most common types of plugs. that\u2019ll get you by in countries, but it\u2019s not a guarantee in places like brazil, south africa, or india. even so, i\u2019ll take this over price gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store. if you want to add color to your campsite, this 18-foot cord contains 20 leds that transmit six colors: violet, turquoise, green, blue, pink, and white. i\u2019m a big fan of ambient lighting, even when i\u2019m 50 miles from the nearest outlet. and while i\u2019ve long been a proponent of , i recently picked up the company\u2019s for car camping and overnight jaunts in the backcountry when i don\u2019t mind toting a little extra weight with me. the 18-foot string is certainly not the brightest you can buy \u2014 it packs a series of 100-lumen leds, whereas your average headlamp might offer 400 \u2014 but it can swap between six different colors and features a 2,000mah battery for when your phone needs some emergency juice. best of all, you can charge the lights via usb or solar, meaning you can spend less time worrying about how to keep them going and more time taking in the vibes. an sd, microsd, and sim card holder with a built-in 3.1 usb-c card reader and sim card removal tool. as a video person who is constantly on the move, there is nothing better than the consolidation of gear \u2014 especially when it pertains to dongles. so when fellow video extraordinaire vjeran pavic ( \u2019s supervising producer) recently surprised me with a very cute birthday note and this magical , i was elated. and if that wasn\u2019t enough, it has a carabiner hook. it is everything i have ever wanted in a rubber case and more. to have both my sd card reader and all my cards in one place is priceless (well, actually $39.95). thank you, vjeran. <3 expanding up to 60 inches, workable as a tripod, and with a bluetooth-enabled remote, this selfie stick makes photo taking much, much easier. when you go on holiday with your partner or family, you generally get stuck with three options when it comes to taking group photographs: a cramped selfie, leaving someone out to take the picture, or asking a total stranger to take it for you. not to be dramatic or anything, but i\u2019d rather not ruin my vacation by trying to figure out which individuals nearby are the least likely to dip the minute i hand over my phone. and it\u2019s depressing to think that my mum is in so few of our family photos because she was always the person on the other side of the camera. a decent bluetooth-enabled tripod can resolve these issues. i\u2019ve had good experiences using \u2014 it features a discreet, detachable bluetooth shutter remote that you can pair with your smartphone, sparing you from having to set a timer and run like hell. simply get into position and use the remote to snap as many shots as you need to ensure it\u2019s caught you at a flattering angle. it also extends up to 60 inches to squeeze everyone into a group selfie if you\u2019re using it as a selfie stick. this could be a brilliant gift for any \u201cinstagram boyfriends\u201d who spend hours of their vacations as their partner\u2019s dedicated paparazzi. qi wireless car charger with a one-touch mechanism and foot that adjusts to fit large and extra-large smartphones up to 3.7 inches. maybe someday apple will realize that it wasn\u2019t the brightest idea and you\u2019ll be able to plop your phone on a magical minimalist disc that charges it at high speeds. in the

than a backpack or knapsack but larger than a dinky clutch. i was wary of the whole \u201cwear a fanny pack as a mini crossbody bag\u201d trend, but earlier this summer, i caved and bought the . now, i cannot go back. this bag easily fits my wallet, phone, house keys, car keys, hand sanitizer, and chapstick \u2014 everything i need when i take walks or run errands. it\u2019s also got a quick-release buckle, so i can stick a carabiner on it and schlepp around a water bottle on hot days. the material is also incredibly durable, spill-proof, and easy to clean. the inside has some dividers but nothing too complicated. but what i probably like most about this fanny pack (and this brand in general) is how colorful their bags are. i got one in lavender, stuck some enamel pins on it, and now there\u2019s absolutely no mistaking this is mine. i can see it easily from a distance, which also makes it harder to lose. the mix between colorful whimsy and practical functionality is something i wish i saw more often. all i\u2019m saying is that two of my friends went out and bought the same bag in different colors as soon as they saw me wearing it. and we\u2019re all immensely happy with our purchases. the chomchom is a reusable cat and dog hair remover that works great for furniture. the is an extraordinarily simple device \u2014 it\u2019s basically a couple of pieces of

still superior if the thing you\u2019re trying to de-pet is yourself). i\u2019d explain more, but honestly, i think the chomchom can best be explained with this gif: i know i\u2019m stretching the definition of \u201ctech\u201d here, but i just had to share the chomchom because the first time i saw someone use it, my jaw dropped. i hope it can change your life like it did mine.

commission.  today, i\u2019m talking with avishai abrahami, the ceo of wix. you might know wix as a website builder. it\u2019s a competitor to wordpress and squarespace. tons of sites across the web run on wix. but the web is changing rapidly, and wix\u2019s business today is less about web publishing and more about providing software to help business owners run their entire companies. it\u2019s fascinating, and avishai has built a fascinating structure inside of wix to make all of that happen. wix is also an israeli company. avishai joined from the company\u2019s headquarters in tel aviv. and i\u2019ll just tell you right up front that we talked about the israel-hamas war and its impact on the company and that this conversation was not always comfortable. but more on that in a moment. the main theme of our conversation was, of course, the future of the web, especially a web that seems destined to be overrun by cheap ai-generated seo spam. i\u2019ve been asking a lot of people why anyone would really want to build a website in 2023. so many small businesses and creators are turning to platforms like tiktok or instagram, never giving the web a second thought. listen to , a show hosted by \u2019s nilay patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems.\u00a0subscribe ! wix is right in the middle of this. the company has invested so heavily in ai that you can now build entire websites by prompting a chatbot on the wix platform. so i really wanted to ask avishai how he\u2019s thinking about all that ai content on the web and if it\u2019s really helping his customers in the long run if the web becomes synonymous with ai-generated garbage. like i said, you\u2019ll hear us talk about wix\u2019s role in the moderation stack because the company sits in a really unique place. on the one end, you have infrastructure providers like cloudflare, which really don\u2019t want to do any moderation and probably shouldn\u2019t. on the other end, social networks like instagram and x (formerly twitter) do a lot of moderation and probably should. wix sits right in the middle alongside other e-commerce and tech platforms like etsy and shopify. i asked avishai about etsy\u2019s recent decision to and asked whether wix would ban the phrase from websites on its platform. it is as complicated a moderation decision as there is. but avishai is the first person we\u2019ve had on who\u2019s been willing to say outright that content moderation is not hard. to him, there\u2019s a clear line, and you\u2019ll hear him explain why wix doesn\u2019t seem to dwell too much on the murkier gray areas of content moderation that major social platforms seem to live in. i also asked avishai how involved the israeli government has been in wix\u2019s operations during the war and whether recent news headlines about the company concerning the conflict might change its approach to moderation overall. one more note before we start. this interview was recorded right before the that led to sam altman\u2019s firing and rehiring in under a single week. you\u2019ll hear avishai and me discuss openai and chatgpt in this conversation. wix is an openai customer and has been relying on that technology for quite some time, so just keep in mind that we had no idea what was about to happen when we had this conversation. okay, avishai abrahami, ceo of wix. here we go. thank you, thank you. my pleasure to be here. we\u2019ve created wix to enable everybody to create web content, websites, easily. as time evolves, the company also evolves. we started by making simple pages in the beginning \u2014 in flash, as funny as it is now. we\u2019ve evolved now to enable you to actually create all of your business on wix. we\u2019ll do anything, from different commerce transactions, to scheduling, to restaurant orders, all the way to managing your backend and [making sure] that you have your customer list, ability to market to your customers. so the full stack runs your small or larger business on the internet, while, at the same time, if you just want to create two pages about something, you can still go to wix and do it easily. in many ways, we try to make it a product that, we always say, it\u2019s not simple. if you know how to use powerpoint or excel, you should know how to use wix. and if you think about excel and powerpoint, they\u2019re not necessarily very easy. they require some knowledge of computers, some skill in computers, but if you have that, then you should be able to create amazing things on wix. that was the goal. yeah. today, wix actually includes a very simple way to write javascript, so anything you can run on the web, you can actually build on top of wix today, and we\u2019ll do the back-end and front-end hosting for you automatically, so you don\u2019t even have to know what it means. in many ways, yes, if you can create on the web, you should be able to create it on wix, in wix, today. we have, of course, templates, but that\u2019s mostly for the visual side. we also have an application for restaurants that we built that enables you to do a lot of the things you need in a restaurant. we have another one that, if you have a hair salon or a gym or an e-commerce or physical store, we built those applications. you can install them on top of wix, and then it allows you to manage your business and get orders, get reservations, manage events. all of this [is] a separate application that you install on top of the wix platform. yes. in fact, if you have a gym, we can actually give you everything you need on the web but also an application, a native iphone or an android application for tablet or for phone, in which you can manage the memberships; you can see who signs in or signs out. you can give an application to your members, if you want, so they can do reservations from your application now, essentially. we give you the full stack to manage your business, the full software stack, and it all connects and works well together. this is another important part of it. it\u2019s not a bunch of different software vendors that you have to integrate. yeah. i think that, beyond intuit, we are number two in the amount of small businesses running on our platform. most of our customers are small businesses. we have enterprise customers as well, and there are people that do it privately, so personal sites. but the vast majority, of course, are small and tiny businesses. we actually do a lot of marketing because i think the brand is now getting so strong that our marketing just needs to support it, but we have about 2 million signups every month. 5,000 and something. no, around the world. we have about half in israel, but we have a lot of people in the united states, in europe, and in many different places. we did very little layoffs. what we did is that, during covid, the demand we got to our services was very big, so we needed to increase the support. as we went from covid and a peak in demand to a global economy slowdown, we found that we needed less people in the support department. when people left, we didn\u2019t rehire. we did a bit of layoffs. yeah. the structure of the company is very similar to what it\u2019s always been. and the company is built around the fact that i, as a ceo, always believe that my number one job is to hire very smart people and then to build startups where you have somebody who owns a part in wix and manage that as if it was a startup. this is how wix is built. for example, we have the editor, which is what essentially you build websites with. but then, you have an application, for example, [for] managing events. that will be its own startup, essentially, meaning we try to make it as independent as possible and to have one guy that, of course, is making the decision. and our job, as management, is to make all of those heads of those startups within wix work well together. exactly. yes. actually, one of the things we did early on, we started by saying, \u201cokay, just code any way you want.\u201d and of course, that works very well in phase one but works very badly in phase two and phase three. today, we have a lot of infrastructure that is unified. for example, we have a project called nile, which is server architecture which automates 95 percent of what you need to do when you build a server for a web application. everybody\u2019s sharing that. and we migrated all the old projects on top of that. then, we have a lot also on the front end. all of the user interface libraries are unified, so we have a common language, a common code, and if we fix a bug in one place, everybody enjoys that. and then, we have rules, like, if you want to add a component to the visual thing, you have two choices. either you use what we have already, or you build it and donate it so everybody can use it. so it\u2019s always growing, but it\u2019s always unified. we do a lot in order to make sure that we work on the same code base as much as possible without slowing down everybody else. as you said, it\u2019s always the trickier and harder part when you have multiple divisions or multiple units working and each one of them wants to do their own thing. but if each one of them does the same thing, it\u2019s going to be horrifying. i\u2019ll give you an example. if you look at how to build a web service, there are tons of blogs. there are millions of resources on the internet, and they\u2019re fantastic when you need to build one. but when you have 1,000 web services running, now it\u2019s a very different problem. it\u2019s not the same problem. and if you look at the amount of information you have now to do and maintain 1,000, it\u2019s actually almost nonexistent. but every company that is growing to a certain size is starting to accumulate all of those very quickly, and you\u2019re going to end up having 100, and then 1,000, then 2,000. and if you don\u2019t start tackling it from a very early point, you find that you have a lot of migration to do, which is always very hard. instead of this agility that you get because everybody did what they wanted at the beginning, it\u2019s actually becoming a terrible thing for agility when you have 20 or 30 services, and then, when you have 1,000, nothing can really happen. this is one of the most important things we tackled, and it requires a lot of discipline. and now, none of the developers like the concept of discipline, meaning, \u201cthis is how you do it.\u201d well, anywhere. the developers, they just read a very fantastic post by somebody on how to do something in a much nicer or interesting way, and then they want to try it. they want to play with it. they want to build something with it. and suddenly, it\u2019s like, \u201coh, no, this is how we do it. you have to do it like that.\u201d or you have to upgrade the old system for everybody, which is a very pricey project. but after a while, what happened is that, if i look at nile, which is one example \u2014 and we have a few of those \u2014 in the beginning, nobody wanted to use it. and we actually had probably more people threaten to resign from wix if we continued to work on that or do that than any other thing we ever did in the history of the company. but as that survey infrastructure became more and more mature, now everybody just wants to use that. there is a point where the value of the platform is getting to this level that it becomes, \u201coh, i just want to do that.\u201d and then, people start to, at the same level of energy that they used to say, \u201ci will never use it,\u201d now, they say, \u201cwell, yes, i absolutely want to use it.\u201d and then, it\u2019s another thing happened. i want to go back and say, \u201cwell, i don\u2019t just want to work on this business logic in those applications. i actually want to go work on that infrastructure.\u201d and we have a bunch of projects like that, and we\u2019re seeing it pretty much continuously in all of them. you just have to be very patient and make sure that your infrastructure is very developer-friendly. and developer-friendly means a lot of things, but once you get that right, i think it\u2019s very, very important. it depends. i think the smallest one we have is about 15. yeah, exactly like that. you touched it exactly. and the concept is that they need to prove what they\u2019re doing is actually viable. at some point, they come back and say, \u201cokay, look at the numbers. obviously, there\u2019s an opportunity here. we\u2019re not thinking there\u2019s an opportunity. we can prove there is an opportunity.\u201d and from that point, we\u2019ll start to increase it in order to maximize that opportunity. and the largest one would be, i don\u2019t know, 190 people. well, the smallest one is in regards to education things on the web, how to do online classes. there are a lot of things that are done there. i think that\u2019s the smallest one. and the largest one, i believe, is the editor team. no. all of the editor group is managed as one, and then it\u2019s broken into two small statuses between and below that. yes. the new one is called studio, by the way, wix studio. it\u2019s one of those things. a lot of the time, i talk to entrepreneurs, and most of the time, younger entrepreneurs, they talk to me about the fact that they make a lot of decisions every day. and i usually say, \u201cwell, i make probably four every quarter.\u201d and i think the number one thing is to understand that it\u2019s much better to make four every quarter than a dozen every day because i mostly try to delegate and to make sure that we know: what are the rules? how do we measure success? how do we enable other people to make smart decisions? and they\u2019ll come and tell me what they want to do, but essentially, it\u2019ll be mostly their decisions and not mine. it\u2019ll be my responsibility but their decisions. we have a full method of how to make decisions. everything is measured. this is number one. we are fanatic about it. we measure everything. if you did something that cannot be measured, then nothing happened. that\u2019s our philosophy. in fact, a lot of the time, don\u2019t tell us about it. don\u2019t come and show off a project that cannot be measured. you can come, by the way, and show us a project that you measured and had a negative effect, and you\u2019re going to get the same amount of cheers as you would for a project that had positive effects because we want to encourage that aggressiveness in testing and going to new places. a lot of data we measure \u2014 from conversion, to what people are saying, to customer feedback, our customer support feedback. and from that, we\u2019re trying to create this big table of the things we think we should be doing and try to assess their value. and from this, we actually build the roadmaps. this is one layer. the other layer is where we want to get to strategically. where we want to get to strategically is another important part. and then we make sure that it\u2019s written, it\u2019s well understood. and then we broadcast it to everybody in the company. this is part of what we call strategic. because you can do those gradual changes, and the internet is a very good place for winning those small bets, but those small bets only take you that far. at some point, you need to change the rules of the game in order to go to the next jump so you can iterate again. i think that there is no single way to anticipate what kind of a change will happen. sometimes, there is some kind of way to assess things because you understand your customers very well. i can tell you that if i build something in ai that will help my customer write blogs, i will definitely utilize more blogs, because i know the pain is there, because i can assess the pain that the customer has. but it\u2019s not always true. and i believe that that\u2019s fine. that\u2019s why i said it\u2019s okay to do things that won\u2019t make a big change. the only thing that is important about that is to recognize the fact that this might happen and to encourage that because you want to take big bets. but the number one metric that we have to predict the future is understanding what customers are saying. if you\u2019re working at wix and you work in product, we actually measure how many conversations you have with customers. and we used to actually really have a number for that so we know exactly how many you had in order to encourage you to always do that. because the most important work of a product guy is to understand the pain of their customers. my philosophy, when it comes to building product \u2014 i think it\u2019s a bit different than most \u2014 but i\u2019ll say it: it\u2019s that everybody always used to tell me that the most important thing is to know, \u201cwho is the customer?\u201d we spoke about excel. who is the customer for excel? who is the customer for an iphone? who is the customer for chrome? well, everybody, right? that\u2019s not a really good answer. but let me ask you, what are they trying to do? what is the guy using word trying to do? what is the guy using chrome trying to do? suddenly, it\u2019s very easy to answer. i believe that to predict good product is to understand, \u201cwhat is the customer trying to do?\u201d\u2014 not who he is. and then, when you understand what they\u2019re trying to do, to build something that makes it easy for him to do it or fun for him to do it. and if you got that right, you can pretty much predict the future. actually, that\u2019s an interesting story. my background is [as] a developer, as you can probably guess from all the technical details. we started to work on ai-related projects in 2014, and then, in 2016, we , which is ai that was creating websites. you told it a little bit, and it created everything for you. it\u2019s very basic ai \u2014 not transformers and not attention-based transformers, of course, that was actually invented in 2017 by the algorithm, but it created decent websites in seconds. but when i tried to get the company, all the team, to use an ai-based project, it was very hard. and i think, last year or a year ago, it became very easy. everybody wanted something to do with ai. before, it was an uphill battle, i think, in many ways. i think adi was the first mass-market product, at least, that actually allowed people to create something with ai. i\u2019m not sure about it. i think it was because millions of people used it. and we learned a lot from that interaction. we learned a lot, so i\u2019m with you. i think that it\u2019s going to be a huge change \u2014 not just in the web, in everything we do. we don\u2019t have our own llm. i think that llm, i hope sam altman won\u2019t get mad at me for saying that, but i think llm is a commodity, and we don\u2019t have any advantage in making one of our own. of course, there are gaps. we are using openai, which i think are the best currently, [the] best in class at this stage, and we\u2019re very happy with the partnership with them. but i think, long term, the difference between the quality of the text that you get from one to the other will continue to shrink. we have a way to look at it, right? we see how much of our customers are actually happy about it. and when we\u2019re talking about our numbers, it\u2019s a pretty decent way to measure it. but to be fair, we never tried to use bard or any of the other ones. we\u2019ve used openai for, i think, almost a year, more than a year now. yeah. we\u2019re actually sponsoring it, at this stage, for our customers, because the value in the conversion is such that it\u2019s worth our time. i don\u2019t think so. maybe to some things, but essentially, if you come to wix today, you can have wix\u2019s openai fill the template with the content that is relevant to you and create a lot of different things with the content that is relevant to you, all using openai. and the value in the conversion from free to paying that we get is higher than what we pay to openai, so i prefer, actually, to keep it free. yeah. well, i hope to stay with openai, because i\u2019ve been their partner for a long time, but i do believe that the cost will go down. what do you think about it? let me reverse the question for a minute. but you have an interesting assumption here. i agree with you on the averaging thing, and i agree with you on the fact that it\u2019s only recycled information. llms are not meant to invent information, but you assume that it\u2019s not going to happen on tiktok and instagram. well, i believe that it\u2019s a matter of a year or a year and a half, and we\u2019re going to see it happening on instagram and tiktok. most of what you\u2019ll see on tiktok can be generated with the equivalent of llm. and that will, again, recycle information. i think you should do both, but essentially, and i see examples every day, the combination is way more powerful than just one. and a lot of people still go to google and do a search. and tiktok, when you do a search, you\u2019re not necessarily going to get what you expect. on the web, you still get what you expect. i think the question of why there is an seo battle is a really interesting one because i think google is way smarter than we give them credit for. i don\u2019t believe that you can fool google by changing your alt text to something. and for some reason, a lot of the time, it does work. and obviously, there are super smart engineers at google, so i would think that a lot of it is on purpose. i also probably have the luxury place of being in the spot where i see more websites than anybody else on the planet, and i know the results on google, so i can see a lot of the things behind the algorithm. if google will decide one day to remove fake content, there\u2019ll be no fair content in google. i really believe so. maybe i\u2019m naive when i give them too much credit, but i think they\u2019re really smart engineers. but for your question, let\u2019s use a business, okay? let\u2019s say, you said a gym before. if you\u2019re a gym, how do people go to check what\u2019s happening in a gym? you\u2019re not going to go to tiktok for that, right? it\u2019s true. by the way, for restaurants, it might be more true, but for a gym when you have this specific activity as an event, a thing you need to register for, it\u2019s not something you\u2019re going to do on instagram. and by the way, for a well-managed restaurant, i would argue that a lot of the things you want to do, you need to be able to communicate with your customers more directly than hope that somehow the instagram algorithm will push it to your customers. and i think, for a majority of businesses, that\u2019s the case. if you want an issue, by the way, a new makeup company for 12-year-old girls, you don\u2019t need a website. you definitely need to be on tiktok and instagram. but for a lot of the others, if you are a doctor, if you are a gym, if you are a lot of e-commerce businesses, i think you still find that your communication with the customer essentially has to be something that you control. yeah, it\u2019s true. i agree, but this is assuming they all just go in and click a button. let me tell you the number one lesson we learned from adi, which is you could go in and say, \u201ci\u2019m a hairdresser from new jersey,\u201d or, \u201ci\u2019m a doctor from montana,\u201d and it will be a fantastic website. and then people didn\u2019t want that. what they wanted is to tell their story. the most important part of adi was not just the ability to build and immediately start with a template. it was actually going in and editing that to your picture, to your images, to your story, and helping our customer achieve that. once we got that right, it became a very successful product. the magic of the ai was really inspiring to see, but it didn\u2019t let people take their story and put it on the web, and i think that was a huge difference. from that, what i learned is that, it\u2019s actually proof to your point, which is to make even our customers, not their customers, happy, they need to be able to tell their story, their personal story. i can generate on midjourney amazing pictures of dishes in a restaurant, fantastic-looking dishes in an amazing restaurant, but if it\u2019s not the real restaurant, it doesn\u2019t really help. so they want to take their images, they want to take that to tell the story of the chef, to tell the story of why they do it. and i think a lot of that is really important and needs to be carried into the story. the good thing is that it\u2019s very easy to see that the text is written by ai. well, for machines. for machines, it\u2019s very easy\u2014 yeah, but because it\u2019s trying to predict 100 percent, and to predict 100 percent is very hard, but to see that almost always the next word is the most likely word to be, or one of the 20 most likely words to be, or one of the 1,000 more likely words to be. so i would imagine that, when google decides to know that, they\u2019ll know it. we don\u2019t sell it like that because you can never guarantee that. and if you want to do a, \u201ci\u2019m a restaurant in new york,\u201d and to tell you that you\u2019re going to be number one ranking, it\u2019s a lie. you might, but it\u2019s not honest. i can say without a doubt that wix, probably today, is the best platform to be ranked by google. when i actually asked google about it, i got a very interesting explanation, which is, you can hardly do any fake seo things on wix. the websites are very honest. the seo engine looks at them the way the website is, while, if you look at other platforms, especially the open-source ones, it\u2019s very easy to do a lot of fake stuff. now, one of the parameters that the bot has, the seo ai, because it\u2019s all ai today, is, \u201cwhat is the platform?\u201d if you look at all the open-source ones, a lot of them look better than they really are. they have this thing that they look better, but google and wix sites look exactly like they should be. what happened is that bard learns it because they keep testing how people interact with the content, with the website. they actually get this penalty, on a relative basis, to a wix website. so the results\u2026 and it\u2019s not just wix, i\u2019m pretty sure that squarespace will have the same phenomenon. if you build a site with a platform that is very clean, you actually get a positive, on a relative basis, you get a positive ranking boost. well, i used to do it a lot because i really wanted to understand it, but now it\u2019s a time when i understand the basics of it and the principles of it, so we have a very smart team that is doing that. i think, overall, it\u2019s about almost 50. a lot of them, their effort is mostly about our customers\u2019 websites, not our website. we use wix to build wix. when we need something in seo, everybody gets it. all of our customers get it. mostly friendly. we are a big customer. we are the biggest reseller, as far as i know, of google, of gmail, so i think pretty friendly, as much as you can be friendly with google. not yet, but i think that it will actually be a beneficial thing, because if you look at websites that compete on exactly the same thing, yeah, it\u2019s not so good to be... for those websites. but if you look at most of our customers, which have real substantial businesses, then google being able to find them and get some of the content easily to the search side and then allow you to go and do the reservation and order, either on the website or on google, it\u2019s actually going to be beneficial for our customers, so i think overall, it\u2019s a good thing. there are a few open-source platforms. i\u2019m not going to be picking which one. but there are those that have a huge amount of seo plug-ins. we try to make your site look better than it is. and the result is that all of the other ones who are using the same platform will be affected by that. every time you do that, you\u2019re affecting everybody and taking everybody a bit down. and then squarespace doesn\u2019t do it, right? so their website, when the ai looks at them, it knows that what it sees, it is what it is. it\u2019s a huge difference. we don\u2019t see it like that. we don\u2019t see it in our customers. and if you look at a lot of them, it\u2019s more about the fact that they need a relationship. and i think that is essential. i think, still, most people, if they want to find something, they still go to google. they don\u2019t go to instagram and start doing searches for local things. yeah, but for what? for restaurants. yeah, but you\u2019re not looking for your gym, probably, on tiktok. maybe you do. i don\u2019t know, but we don\u2019t see a decline in traffic. i might be wrong, but i think i have the most broad view on the planet except google because we have more websites than anybody else that we actually manage. and i think we\u2019re about twice the size of squarespace in terms of sites. i\u2019m not, actually. i\u2019m not so concerned. i never understand the concern here so much. if you can explain to me the concern better, maybe i\u2019ll know what\u2014 of course. but i think a lot of it is mostly for publishers. and i think, publishers, yeah, they do have an issue, and we know that. why? because they used to be able to publish their articles on facebook and then get people to come to their website. and that stopped because facebook stopped it. it never did it, as you mentioned. but i think small businesses are in a bit of a different place. maybe i\u2019m wrong, but we don\u2019t see a difference in the amount of traffic that is coming. in fact, over time, we see an increase. and i think that ai that is able to, if google bard becomes a tool on the internet where you\u2019re able to do a lot of the transaction from bard itself, it\u2019s a good thing for small businesses because you\u2019re still going to need your business stack. you\u2019re still going to need to do the transaction, the registration to events. you still need to be able to say, \u201coh, we have a discount.\u201d you still need to be able to do, \u201cokay, you can buy this and get that.\u201d you still need to manage the whole offering, your story, the story that bard tells. unless bard is going to be a way for you to start composing the content as well, you\u2019d still need to be able to tell your story, your images, your content, your product, your sales, your special offers. and if bard is able to communicate with that and increase conversion for small businesses, i think that\u2019s fantastic. and by the way, it\u2019s fantastic for us as well. i think that, hopefully, we\u2019re going to see more of that and not less of that. if i were , i would have a lot of concerns, but that\u2019s a different story. no, i know. but i think that\u2019s great. i really believe that this can help a lot of our customers. i\u2019m not sure, by the way, what\u2019s going to be the business model. that\u2019s another interesting thing. yeah, but they usually make money out of two things: advertisements on youtube and advertisements on the web. and the cost of most advertising is higher than the value of the transaction, meaning that you always, in a lot of businesses, you actually make money on the second transaction. you\u2019re trying to capture the customer, but the cost of the ad is much higher than the value of the first transaction, so taking 30 percent of that would mean that they cut their revenues by about 80 percent. i\u2019m not sure i understand how that would work, but they\u2019re smart guys. as i said, they have really smart people there. of course. also, we had covid, which here, it was a big thing. not in israel specifically, but for wix, because we had all those people that joined wix and really needed us in many ways. we had our own small war of assisting millions and millions of small businesses survive covid. then we had about 1,000 employees in ukraine, so we had the war in ukraine. and now we have this one here. i got to say, those are a hard couple of years, and i really hope the next year will be very boring. no big wars, no big plagues. of course, to say that we are more practiced now and how to handle such crises, it\u2019s pretty much a sad thing. i think wix is a strong company. we have international teams, local teams, and i think we\u2019re in a place that we can navigate that in the best way we can at this stage. i\u2019m not sure i understand\u2014 well, i think that, at this stage, what we do is try to focus on helping humanitarian aid as much as we can, locally, here. something that you don\u2019t know, we actually have people working for wix in the west bank. think about that for a minute. we have people, the same thing as we have in ukraine. i think our goal, as a company, is to focus on the human side and to do our best to help the humanitarian efforts and supporting food for people that were evacuated from homes and do what we can to do that. we have employees, i think, from both sides. we have here non-religious jewish, orthodox jewish, arabs, muslim arabs, working at wix. we have all of the different kind of colors, and i think that\u2019s a good thing. personally, i\u2019m not a political figure. i don\u2019t know a lot about the reform, the suggested reforms. i think democracy is a value, is a super important one, and we should do everything we can to make sure that democracy is maintained here, and by the way, spread around the world. yes, that\u2019s true. yeah, absolutely. every hate speech. there are many. i\u2019m not trying... by the way, i want to be clear. i think that, if you go to israel, 90 percent of people are pro-palestinian, which i don\u2019t think that hamas is pro-palestinian. i think there is a big difference. i think [joe] biden was the one emphasizing that. and i think our goal, as a publisher platform, is to make sure that hate speech, racism, in every kind of its forms, is not something that is on our platform. and there are other things. by the way, if you upload pedophile content, we\u2019re not just going to remove it, we\u2019re also going to report you to the fbi. and this is, i think, some of our moral obligation, and we need to maintain that. no, actually, absolutely not. i\u2019m not sure i understand the\u2014 well, i think it\u2019s quite obvious. . by the way, if you go around here and talk to most of the palestinians, they\u2019re not in support of hamas. \u2026 calling to the destruction of israel, yes. no. how has the meaning of that phrase changed over time? i think you\u2019re making me very uncomfortable now. i would rather not\u2014 i\u2019m not sure how the meaning changed there. it\u2019s the same river. this river has been for very long\u2026 how did the meaning change from the \u201960s to now? there is one\u2014 it only exists from the river to the sea. there is no other thing. actually, i haven\u2019t checked. i haven\u2019t checked that. i trust my team to do what is right, but i haven\u2019t specifically checked that. i got to tell you, no, she was not punished because of the contact of the political context. it\u2019s that when you call a terrorist to somebody who\u2019s a colleague of yours while his family has been kidnapped or assassinated, we look at you as a bit of an asshole, and we have a policy that we don\u2019t hire or employ assholes. we were very clear on the behavioral side of that, and employees should have whatever political opinion they want. i don\u2019t think so. i actually don\u2019t agree with you. i think that the obligation to remove hate speech is not a blurry place. i think it\u2019s a very clear place. and i think that the difference, most of the time, is very obvious. and by the way, we would remove a lot of things that\u2026 if we had a kkk website. it\u2019s a real story: that it is nice; that people give us the worst reputation; we\u2019re a new kind of kkk, and we want to sell those things, look at them, none of them is about hate speech. we wouldn\u2019t allow that because it\u2019s very obvious. i don\u2019t necessarily agree with you on the fact that we are in a blurry place on wix, on the stack. we are very clear that, use our software for anything you want, but don\u2019t spread hate, don\u2019t spread pedophiles, don\u2019t do scam sites, don\u2019t do any of those things. no. no, i think that policy\u2019s been existing for a very long time. and by the way, we are very proud of it. one of the reasons we never went into china, which probably cost us a lot of money, is that it was obvious what it requires, what it entailed. and we felt that this is something that we can\u2019t do with our values, anything... that\u2019s another example. that was always a part of it. you can do, really, almost anything you want to do with wix. if you want to build a porn site, that\u2019s fine. we\u2019re not going to take it down. we\u2019re not going to tell you anything. but once you cross the line, and that line is very clear. hate speech, it\u2019s pedophiles, it\u2019s scam sites, spam sites, a lot of other things, we will immediately do our best to remove you. and i think it\u2019s very sad that this is not a bigger phenomenon. i think that creates a lot of negative things on the planet. well, we should have less rules than instagram. i do understand why you don\u2019t have porn on instagram, because kids are exposed to that and other people that might be surprised by that. i think that the amount of safety that they should impose on content is much higher than us, which is on the web. however, i do believe that, in many ways, we\u2019re a publishing tool like instagram, so in many ways, we have the same similar responsibility, just on a smaller scale. and i think that is a good thing that we are seeing companies making sure that they provide quality, which is not propagating hate or other terrible things and instead trying to mediate that. i agree with you that i don\u2019t think it should be imposed by the internet providers or by amazon, aws. i think that that is maybe one level too low. everybody always talks about free speech, but free speech is illegal in most countries, including the united states. you cannot go and say anything you want. and if you do say a lot of things and somebody will kill you, it\u2019ll be acceptable, and maybe for good reasons. i think, like every ideal, free speech is a beautiful ideal, but then apparently people need to manage it. we do some things there, yes, but we never felt that there is too much of a need. we didn\u2019t see examples where we needed to really do a lot there. not as much, maybe, as you might think, but i think openai is doing a really good job at that. it\u2019s very hard to get the model to say something that is not politically correct. by the way, that\u2019s a very good question. should openai, how much should they impose that? that\u2019s even a more interesting question than instagram or wix. openai, it\u2019s really interesting. is it okay that they are very, well, kind of, i don\u2019t know, in my mind, i\u2019m biased into one very liberal opinion, which i share a lot of it, so maybe it\u2019s a good thing for me personally, but is that okay that they remove a lot of the other sites? i don\u2019t know. what do you think? interesting. also very interesting. i think that, essentially, it might not be the best thing for free speech, but it\u2019s definitely the best thing for the business of openai long term. i never thought about it like that. i think that\u2019s really interesting. by the way, i think i do agree with you. i think that the more llms write the content that most of us read, it should be even more sensitive than instagram or facebook. i got to tell you something, i\u2019m the opposite of everybody else about hallucinations. i think the hallucinations are the best part about llm, because i think hallucinations are when the llm is creative. and i think that this is the only spark of intelligence we actually see there. i think the rest of it is just those compressed data in the neurons that is coming out. but when it comes to inventing things, this is where it kind of uses the equivalent of intuition to create low-level intelligence. i\u2019m actually more impressed by that. and it\u2019s true that you cannot trust the facts that it gives you. and there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s going to take a long time to fix that, as hallucinations are essentially a huge part of the algorithm. but i still think that, for me, it\u2019s the most fascinating part of the algorithm. actually, you can probably do that already. we have a new version coming, which is ai that actually fully creates the website for you. it\u2019s a very, very modern generation of adi that we did in 2016. and maybe we can give it a mode to make everything hallucinated. well, yeah, of course. this is actually one of the big things that we always have to work with. and to make sure that it\u2019s obvious what is a text that it was reading for the business owner, and what is the text that it should review, and what is the text that it shouldn\u2019t review, and how do we give them tools to fix it and to correct things and to make sure that they don\u2019t repeat. and this is even getting more complex in some of our projects where it\u2019s not just one interaction but multiples. but i think everybody who\u2019s using llms for anything real is facing similar challenges. and the issue is that the hallucination is essentially a huge part of the algorithm. it\u2019s going to be very hard to take it out and getting something that is factually corrected without just going around and doing searching, if that\u2019s the correct answer, by doing search. you mean about\u2026 it\u2019s almost there. i think that, from what i understand, currently, there are probably around 8 million bots running and managing most of the messaging on the internet, which is insane. think about it. just think about it. you\u2019re having a conversation on things, and the ones who push agendas are bots run by ai models, not humans anymore. and this is like, \u201cwhat?\u201d and we are at version 0.1. we\u2019re not even at version 1.0 of that. i think that 10 years from today, the human mind will be so heavily influenced by bots and by ai models that we can\u2019t even imagine that. and that is really scary because\u2026 i think it\u2019s super fascinating. it\u2019s really going to be probably one of the most important subjects of the near future. that\u2019ll be amazing. how do you distinguish? but i got to say, i love the coding thing. i love copilot. i think it\u2019s fantastic, especially when you\u2019re old like me and you don\u2019t code every day, then what happens is that you don\u2019t remember the syntax all the time, and it just does it for you immediately. that\u2019s fantastic. but i also use it. english is not my first language. and for me, when i write something and i want to make it a bit better, i use chatgpt for that, and that\u2019s really helpful. but it\u2019s usually my message. i got to say, i think both uses are fine. and yes, probably i would love to hear your interview with you and not with an ai who tried to do the average of what you said over all the conversations that it trained on. that\u2019s probably going to be extremely boring, right? . but i hope so. i don\u2019t know. i think it\u2019s going to be interesting. i think the trump election was the first one where we\u2019ve seen the massive effect of bots \u2014 or at least it was suspected, i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not, i never managed to understand \u2014 on the election, and i think it\u2019s just growing every day. i think we\u2019re seeing it every day, that there\u2019s going to be more and more influence of bots on our life, on our opinions, on the creation of human interaction, on fake news, on so many other things. it\u2019s really, in many ways, as you said, scary. but how? that\u2019s what concerns me. i\u2019m not sure i understand how. oh, right. you can do that. you can do that. okay. those are probably mostly owned by bots. i tend to believe that it will be necessary because, if not, we\u2019re going to need to be in a place that most of our online conversations are going to be not with humans. i think we both can agree on that. llm is what? the first article was written in 2017. that is transformer-based architecture. and we are what? yeah, \u201cattention is all you need.\u201d and we are just starting. we\u2019re not even version, as i said, 0.1, and it can already imitate behavior completely, again, with very processed and repeated information, but it can carry very clear messaging. and what will happen in 10 years? we\u2019re going to have... just the amount of resources placed into that now is exponentially bigger than it was in 2018 or 2019 or 2020. and it keeps growing. and of course, you can now make full instagram profiles of people that don\u2019t exist and images from them everywhere. i really hope so because, if not, it\u2019s going to be a concern. i always tell my wife that i think we should make sure that our daughter has a profession that is ai-resistant, resilient. and then, she\u2019s like, \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d i said, \u201cwell, she should probably\u2014\u201d i should tell her that, actually, doctors are probably not ai-resilient. actually, they will be replaced by ai at some point. i always said, \u201ca playstation professional player.\u201d and there, she has an advantage as a girl, i think, right? they have an advantage. and then a tiktok influencer, but apparently a tiktok influencer can be replaced by ai, so maybe that\u2019s not going to work. i think number one is that you\u2019re going to see some really good projects built with ai that are coming. and we spoke about them, and i\u2019m very excited. the first one that we\u2019ve released has seen tremendous results, measurable results, the first couple of projects, which i\u2019m very excited about. more than once, i was surprised by how much of a difference it made or how engaged people are with ai models. we\u2019re going to continue to evolve wix studio, which is our developers agencies product for agencies. it\u2019s been doing very well so far. we just launched it. and i think the next version is actually going to have some really interesting way of how to manage your data and design. again, some of it is powered by ai, some by algorithms, but i think there are a lot of really cool things that you can change, so a lot of that. a pleasure. cheers. a podcast about big ideas and other problems. / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"},

electricity around the clock by 2030. to reach that goal, it\u2019ll have to get more sources of clean energy online. and it sees geothermal as a key part of the future electricity mix that can fill in whenever wind and solar energy wane. \u201cif you think about how much we advanced wind and solar and lithium ion storage, here we are \u2014\u00a0this is kind of the next set of stuff and we feel like companies have a huge role to play in advancing these technologies.\u201d \u201cif you think about how much we advanced wind and solar and lithium ion storage, here we are \u2014\u00a0this is kind of the next set of stuff and we feel like companies have a huge role to play in advancing these technologies,\u201d says michael terrell, senior director of energy and climate at google. the has been in the works since 2021, when google the \u201cworld\u2019s first corporate agreement to develop a next-generation geothermal power project.\u201d geothermal energy takes advantage of\u00a0heat emanating from within the earth. but this effort is , which would typically draw up hot fluids from natural reservoirs to produce steam that turns turbines. this new project actually was built on the outskirts of an existing geothermal field where, in terrell\u2019s words, \u201cthere\u2019s hot rock, but there\u2019s no fluid.\u201d to generate geoethermal energy there, fervo had to drill two horizontal wells through which it pumps water. fervo pushes cold water through fractures in the rock, which heats it up so it can generate steam back at the surface. it\u2019s a closed-loop system, so the water gets reused \u2014 an important feature in a drought-prone region like nevada. fervo also installed fiber optic cables inside the two wells in order to gather\u00a0real-time data on flow, temperature, and performance of its geothermal system. these are tactics gleaned from the oil and gas industry to tap energy resources that otherwise would have been out of reach. \u201cthis one was super promising to us because it was already leveraging existing technologies that have been used in the oil and gas space,\u201d terrell says. \u201cand so we felt like it had a lot of potential, and a lot of potential to get online sooner rather than later.\u201d aside from this deal with google, fervo also has backing for its technology by bill gates\u2019 climate investment firm breakthrough energy ventures and the us department of energy. unlike wind and solar farms that are sensitive to weather and time of day, geothermal projects can generate electricity on a more consistent basis. that\u2019s one reason why google is working to bring more projects like this online. in september, it another partnership with the nonprofit project innerspace to \u201cleverage their respective strengths to address critical challenges facing geothermal development, including the development of a global geothermal resource mapping and assessment tool.\u201d for now, the company is keeping mum on where else it might try to deploy geothermal energy for its data centers. data centers are a ton of electricity, using up around of global electricity.  / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9
