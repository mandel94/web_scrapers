simultaneously, aws announced a new chip for training ai models, an nvidia gpu alternative.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/28/amazon-reveals-trainium2-ai-chip-while-deepening-nvidia-relationship.html", "author": "jordan novet", "body": "amazon web services announced trainium2, a chip for training artificial intelligence models, and it will also offer access to nvidia's next-generation h200 tensor core graphics processing units. aws will host a special computing cluster for customers and nvidia to use. for now, aws customers can start testing new general-purpose graviton4 chips. amazon's aws cloud unit has announced new chips for customers to build and run artificial intelligence applications on, as well as plans to offer access to nvidia's latest chips. amazon web services is trying to stand out as a cloud provider with a variety of cost-effective options. it won't just sell cheap amazon-branded products, though. just as in its online retail marketplace, amazon's cloud will feature top-of-the-line products from other vendors, including highly sought after gpus from top ai chipmaker nvidia . demand for nvidia gpus has skyrocketed since startup openai released its chatgpt chatbot last year, wowing people with its abilities to summarize information and compose human-like text. it led to a shortage of nvidia's chips as companies raced to incorporate similar generative ai technologies into their products. amazon's dual-pronged approach of both building its own chips and letting customers access nvidia's latest chips might will help it against its top cloud computing competitor, microsoft. earlier this month, microsoft took a similar approach by revealing its inaugural ai chip, the maia 100 , and also saying the azure cloud will have nvidia h200 gpus. the announcements came at the reinvent conference in las vegas on tuesday. specifically, aws said it will offer access to nvidia's latest h200 ai graphics processing units. it also announced its new trainium2 artificial intelligence chip and the general-purpose graviton4 processor. the new nvidia gpu is an upgrade from the h100, the chip openai used to train its most advanced large language model, gpt-4. big companies , startups and government agencies are all vying for a limited supply of the chips, meaning there's high demand for renting them out from cloud providers like amazon as well. nvidia has said the h200 will generate output nearly twice as fast as the h100. amazon's own trainium2 chips are built for training ai models, including the sort that ai chatbots like openai's chatgpt and its competitors run on. startup databricks and amazon-backed anthropic , an openai competitor, plan to build models with the new trainium2 chips, which will boast four times better performance than the original model, amazon said. the graviton4 processors are based on arm architecture and consume less energy than chips from intel or amd . graviton4 promises 30% better performance than the existing graviton3 chips, enabling what aws said is better output for the price. inflation has been higher than usual, inspiring central bankers to hike interest rates. organizations that want to keep using aws but lower their cloud bills to better deal with the economy might wish to consider moving to graviton. more than 50,000 aws customers are already using graviton chips, amazon said. finally, as part of its deepening relationship with nvidia, aws said it will operate more than 16,000 nvidia gh200 grace hopper superchips, which contain nvidia gpus and nvidia's arm-based general-purpose processors. nvidia's own research and development group and aws customers will both be able to take advantage of this infrastructure. aws has launched more than 200 cloud products since 2006, when it released its ec2 and s3 services for computing and storing data. not all of them have been hits. some go without updates for a long time and a rare few are discontinued, freeing up amazon to reallocate resources. however, the company continues to invest in the graviton and trainium programs, suggesting that amazon senses demand. aws didn't announce release dates for virtual-machine instances with nvidia h200 chips, nor instances relying on its trainium2 silicon. customers can start testing graviton4 virtual-machine instances now before they become commercially available in the next few months. watch:  analysts are going to have to raise their aws growth estimates, says

pinduoduo outpaced alibaba in revenue growth as consumers increasingly look for bargains. on tuesday, pinduoduo, known for its bargain-priced products, said third quarter revenue surged by well over 90% in the third quarter from a year ago \u2013 exceeding lseg analysts' expectations. pinduoduo's surging revenue contrasts with far slower growth in the third quarter for chinese e-commerce giants alibaba and\u00a0jd.com. consumers in china are hunting for bargains when they spend, the latest earnings from online retailers show. chinese e-commerce giant pinduoduo posted 94% growth in third-quarter revenue, far\u00a0outpacing alibaba 's 9% growth during the same period. pinduoduo , known for its bargain-priced products, said tuesday that third quarter revenue was the equivalent of $9.44 billion \u2013 beating revenue forecasts, according to lseg. pinduoduo said revenue from transactions skyrocketed by 315% in the third quarter to nearly $4 billion. shares of pinduoduo surged more than 18% in u.s. trading on tuesday. the company also owns temu, the fast-growing global e-commerce company. pinduoduo management said it was able to reach consumers in more than 40 countries but described its global business as \"still in a very early stage,\" according to a transcript accessed through factset. \"this will be iterative process that will be challenging, but at the same time interesting.\" in october, jpmorgan estimated that despite losses, temu this year will generate gross merchandise volume of 70 billion yuan ($957 million) \u2014 and more than double in 2024. launched

of app stores and subsequently expanded rapidly across countries such as australia, new zealand, france, italy, germany, the netherlands, spain, and the u.k. pinduoduo's surging revenue contrasts with far slower growth in the third quarter for chinese e-commerce giants alibaba and jd.com , which tend to sell higher-priced items and remain industry heavyweights. alibaba reported 9% year-on-year growth in the third quarter to the equivalent of about $31 billion. however, alibaba's net income for the third quarter missed expectations . jd missed third-quarter revenue estimates, according to lseg data, despite net revenue rising 1.7% in the quarter from a year ago to the equivalent of $34 billion. in another sign that consumers in china are more cost-conscious, meituan management said in an earnings call tuesday that consumers in china \"tend to be more cautious and prefer value for money selections.\" food delivery giant meituan said tuesday its revenue rose by 22.1% to $10.81 billion in the third quarter from a year ago. adjusted net profit rose 62.4% in the third quarter from a year ago. despite positive results, meituan management warned of a slowdown in growth in its main food delivery business in the fourth quarter. meituan's hong kong-listed shares tumbled 12% on wednesday to their lowest since march 2020, according to lseg data. meituan was the biggest loser on the hang seng index on wednesday. \"there are several factors affecting the order volume growth. first, the impact from current macroenvironment order volume growth, especially in workplace scenarios. second, this year's weather is pretty warm in october and november,\" said cfo shao hui chen during the earnings call on tuesday. \"so more people return to offline consumption as compared to last year, [which] negatively impact the deliveries' order volume growth,\" said chen. \"on financial outlook, we think q4 revenue year-over-year growth for food delivery will be slightly lower than the q3 growth rate.\" analysts said china's economy is recovering but it's going to be a gradual one. china posted 4.9% growth in the july to september quarter compared to a year ago, performing better than economists ' expectations of 4.6%. \"consumers have started to spend more money, but they still maintain a cautious attitude when it comes to how they are spending the money. nowadays the consumption
