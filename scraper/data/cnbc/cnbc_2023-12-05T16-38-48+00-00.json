(jac) for 3.16 billion yuan. jac currently manufactures nio cars. li said that bringing manufacturing entirely in house could reduce the costs of such operations by 10%, but that the company would exclude battery manufacturing from being drafted in-house, as the measure would not improve gross margin. nio cfo steven wei feng said that the company's vehicle margin, which was 11% in the third quarter, can rise to 15% in the fourth quarter, helped by lower material and component costs, as well as better manufacturing capacity. in 2024, the company is targeting a vehicle margin of between 15% and 18%, the cfo said."},

start of a new bull run with a growing number of voices calling for fresh all-time highs for bitcoin in 2024 above $100,000. excitement around a bitcoin etf being approved in the u.s. next year as well as the bitcoin halving is fueling a rally in cryptocurrencies. many commentators also see the conclusion of the ftx case and the binance settlement with the u.s. department of justice as the resolution of two outstanding issues that were plaguing the market. executives in the cryptocurrency industry called the start of a new bull run with a growing number of voices calling for fresh all-time highs for bitcoin in 2024 above $100,000. bitcoin has rallied more than 120% this year, with many optimistic about the surge continuing into 2024. \"it feels that [2023]was a year to get ready for the bull run that is yet to come. but the sentiment is very hopeful for [2024] and 25,\" pascal gauthier, ceo of ledger, told cnbc last week in an interview. the digital currency's last record high of nearly $69,000 was hit in november 2021. since then, the crypto industry has been hit with a litany of issues from the collapse of coins and projects to bankruptcies and criminal trials. ftx, once one of the world's biggest exchanges, collapsed with its founder sam bankman-fried facing over 100 years in prison after he was found guilty on seven counts of criminal fraud . meanwhile, binance chief changpeng zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down as the company's ceo as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the u.s. department of justice. many in the industry see the two cases concluding as a line being drawn under issues that have plagued the crypto market. \"i think that once you get the speculative phase out of the way, which i think we're almost done with, probably not yet completely done, then you can get real builders focusing on the technology and the problems that can solve in the world, rather than just having a giant digital casino for people to trade,\" david marcus, ceo of lightspark, told cnbc last week in an interview. marcus, the former leader of facebook's failed diem stablecoin project , is now working on technology to improve bitcoin as a payments network. now that those issues are out the way, investors are focused on what the industry sees as positive developments. the first is the growing excitement that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or etf, might be approved soon . this could bring in larger traditional investors who previously did not want to touch crypto. \"i think what the etf means really is that bitcoin is going mainstream, and that's what people were waiting for,\" gauthier said. the second development is the bitcoin halving, which takes place every four years and is scheduled for may 2024. halving is when miners, which are entities who uphold the bitcoin network, see the rewards for their work cut in half. this keeps a cap on the supply of bitcoin \u2014 of which there will ever only be 21 million coins \u2014 and often is a factor behind a new rally. \"a number of market participants are expecting a bull run some time after the halving, but given the etf news, we could very well have a run before that leaving most investors on the sidelines. that could cause a massive upward run in the price,\" vijay ayyar, vice president of international markets at cryptocurrency exchange coindcx, told cnbc. there have already been some bold calls for bitcoin in 2024. it began with standard chartered last week which reiterated an april price call that bitcoin would hit $100,000 by end of 2024. the bank said this will be driven by the approvals of numerous etfs. that would mean a roughly 160% rally from friday's price of around $38,413, according to coindesk data. matrixport, which bills itself as a crypto financial services firm, released a note last week projecting bitcoin would reach $63,140 by april 2024 and $125,000 by the end of next year. \"based on our inflation model, the macro environment is expected to remain a robust tailwind for crypto. another decline in inflation is anticipated, prompting the federal reserve to likely initiate interest rate cuts,\" matrixport said in its report. \"combined with geopolitical crosscurrents, this healthy dose of monetary support should push bitcoin to new highs in 2024.\" many commentators see easing monetary policy as supportive for bitcoin which is viewed as a risky asset. meanwhile, some see bitcoin as a sort of \"safe haven\" asset to pour money into in times of geopolitical strife. when asked if bitcoin would hit $100,000 in 2024, gauthier said \"maybe,\" but declined to give a price prediction. \"what we see is strong fundamentals,\" he said. ayyar said that the price of bitcoin is \"consolidating\" below a \"key level\" of $38,000, which is bullish for bitcoin. once this level is broke, bitcoin could rally to between $45,000 and $48,000 next, he said. however, he warned the rally, which is in large part built on expectations of an etf approval, could fail if the product is rejected by regulators again. \"an all out etf rejection could play havoc to this run as well, hence definitely something to be mindful of,\" he said. correction: this story has been updated to reflect bitcoin's record high price."},

\"if you know sam [altman], he likes to cycle through topics at a high rate, so the fact that we spent this much time on one topic meant it was important,\" brad lightcap, coo of openai, told cnbc, adding, \"it was a debate \u2013 people were not 100% sure that this was going to be the right thing to do or something worth our time.\" at the time, lightcap said, openai had a limited number of gpus and capacity, and largely thought of itself as a company that builds tools for developers and businesses. he recalled that altman, ceo, was a big proponent of \"just trying it,\" his thesis being that there was something important and personal about text-based interaction with the models. the move paid off. chatgpt broke records as the fastest-growing consumer app in history, and now has about 100 million weekly active users, along with more than 92% of fortune 500 companies using the platform, according to openai. earlier this year, microsoft invested an additional $10 billion in the company, making it the biggest ai investment of the year, according to pitchbook, and openai is reportedly in talks to close a deal that would lead to an $86 billion valuation . but recently, those milestones have been eclipsed by a roller coaster couple of weeks at the company. last month, openai's board ousted altman , prompting resignations \u2013 or threats of resignations \u2013 including an open letter signed by virtually all of openai's employees, and uproar from investors, including microsoft. within a week, altman was back at the company . last wednesday, openai announced a new board , including former salesforce co-ceo bret taylor, former treasury secretary larry summers and quora ceo adam d'angelo. microsoft obtained a nonvoting board observer position. cnbc caught up with lightcap last month after the company's first in-person event, dev day, and then briefly chatted with him again last week after the leadership changes. this interview has been edited for length and clarity. we're coming up on the year anniversary of chatgpt. this time last year, weeks before its debut, dall-e was under research preview, stable diffusion was getting a lot of attention, and your chatbot didn't exist yet. what was it like on the team then? i think at that point we very much were thinking of ourselves as a company that built tools for developers, so it was a little bit of a new flavor of thing for us to have to think about, 'ok, this is something that the average person could pick up and use.' we had a flavor of that with dall-e \u2013 we had launched it in the spring, and we'd let people basically play with it and we saw a lot of fanfare and excitement there. but we always thought \u2013 because dall-e was such a visual medium \u2013 that it was going to be the high watermark for what the consumer level of interest would be in these tools. so i think when we were looking at chatgpt, we were using dall-e as a little bit of a benchmark for what success might look like, in terms of just how many people would use this, who would be interested in it, would this be something that people played with for a little bit and decided that this isn't really a tool and is more of a toy. i remember us taking bets on how large chatgpt would ever get. i think i had one of the more aggressive bets, which was a million concurrent users at any given point at the apex of our use, and we were trying to plan against that, and of course i was trying to run all the models against that, as the finance person. so that was kind of where we were, and we were very wrong. what did you predict as far as the business opportunity, and how did the rollout and adoption differ from your expectations? at the time, there was no way to know all the things that it could be useful for. and i think that's the paradox, somewhat, of this technology \u2013 it's so broadly useful, and it kind of seeps into all the cracks of the world and all the cracks of your life as a tool in places that you didn't know you needed a tool. so you do the business analysis ahead of time, and you try and think, \"ok, well, what would people use this for? what would drive sustained consumption of it?\" and you try and assign it utility. you try and think about it as, \"people might use it for creative writing, they might use it for this or that.\" and in a way, there were so many things that now, in retrospect, we know people use it for, but at the time, we could never conceive of \u2013 to justify why this was ever going to be such a big thing. there's maybe an interesting lesson there, which is that the business analysis doesn't always tell the story, but being able to take a bet and really clue in on where something is going to have broad-based utility, broad-based value, and where it's going to resonate with people as a new thing \u2013 sometimes that has to trump the business analysis. in august, 80% of fortune 500 companies had adopted chatgpt. now, as of november, you're at 92%. as far as that remaining 8% of companies that haven't adopted the tool yet, have you noticed any trends? my guess is it's probably heavy industry in some senses. \u2026 big, capital-intensive industries like oil and gas, or industries with a lot of heavy machinery, where the work is more about production of a good and a little bit less about being an information business or a services business. in your eyes, what's the most overhyped and underhyped aspect \u2013 specifically \u2013 of ai today? i think the overhyped aspect is that it, in one fell swoop, can deliver substantive business change. we talk to a lot of companies that come in and they want to kind of hang on us the thing that they've wanted to do for a long time \u2013 \"we want to get revenue growth back to 15% year over year,\" or \"we want to cut x million dollars of cost out of this cost line.\" and there's almost never a silver bullet answer there \u2013 there's never one thing you can do with ai that solves that problem in full. and i think that's just a testament to the world being really big and messy, and that these systems are still evolving, they're still really in their infancy. the thing that we do see, and i think where they are underhyped, is the level of individual empowerment and enablement that these systems create for their end users. that story is not told, and the things that we hear from our users or customers are about people who now have superpowers because of what the tools allow them to do, that those people couldn't previously do. let's talk about the business of generative ai. critics say there are consumer apps galore, but is there a risk of saturation? what does the technology really mean for business? we're in this really early period, and i think it's really important that we maintain the ability for the world to sustain a very high rate of experimentation and a very high rate of trial and error. if you look at historical trends of past phase shifts in technology, there's always this really important experimentation phase. it's very hard to get the technology right from day zero. we get there eventually \u2013 the end state of the technology, we eventually converge to that point \u2013 but it's only after really trying a lot of things and seeing what works and then seeing what doesn't, and for people to build on top of the things that work, to create the next best things. my spicy take on this is i think the most important things that get built on top of this technology are actually things that haven't been created yet. because it takes some cycles of building with the tools to really understand what they're capable of, and then how to combine the tools with other aspects of technology to create something that's really greater than the sum of its parts. and so that's to be expected, i think it's very healthy. years ago, people were surprised by ai's level of use in trucking \u2013 it was seen by some as too traditional of an industry, and now we're at the point when ai is part of virtually every sector. as far as adoption trends you're seeing in recent years, is there a through line like that \u2013 an industry using ai in a new or different way that you're especially surprised by? there's definitely high pull with technical industries. i think one thing that we've seen is it's a great technical assistant \u2013 whether you're a software engineer, mechanical engineer, chemist or biologist, there's a vast pool of knowledge that sits on the other side of your discipline that your mastery of kind of dictates your effectiveness. i think people spend their careers just trying to master that discipline, by trying to absorb as much knowledge as they can about the domain. and especially in some domains, whether it's, you know, biology or chemistry or ai, the literature on the field is constantly evolving and constantly expanding \u2013 there's constantly new things being discovered, new studies being done. so i don't know if it's the most surprising thing per se, but one of the coolest things we see is chatgpt acting almost like a sidekick in that regard, almost like a research assistant. \u2026 we feel the pull from those industries in a way that, sitting back where i did in november of 2022, i would not have expected. we're now a couple of months into chatgpt enterprise. i remember you launched after less than a year of development, with more than 20 beta tester companies like block and canva. how, specifically, has usage grown? who are some of your biggest clients since launch, and how much of a revenue driver is it for openai? the enthusiasm has been overwhelming. we're still a smallish team, so we don't offer the product self-serve as of today \u2013 we will imminently \u2013 but we've tried to get through as many interested parties as we can get through. \u2026 a lot of the focus of the last two months was really making sure that those first few customers that we implemented and onboarded saw value in the product. \u2026 we're still working through waitlists of many, many, many thousands, and our hope is to get to everyone, and that's going to be a goal for 2024. now that we have chatgpt enterprise, what's the current biggest revenue driver for openai? how do you think that will evolve? we almost never take a revenue-centric approach to what we build and how we launch stuff. we almost always take a usage-centric approach, which is that we very much look at the things we build as needing to qualify in one of two areas \u2013 they need to be really useful tools for developers to go off and build things or they need to be really useful abstractions for users to find more value in the product. so that was basically how we looked at [the] launch. it actually kind of maps quite perfectly if you look at gpts, for example \u2013 it's something that checks the box, hopefully, on that second part: \"is this a way to abstract the power of the intelligence in chatgpt and to point it at something that's very specific, and to give it the right context, the right tools, the right connections, to be able to get really good at solving for a specific thing?\" that may be a thing that's useful in your work, or maybe a thing that's useful in your life, or it may just be a fun thing \u2013 it may just be that you create a funny gpt and it's a cool thing to have. chatgpt going multimodal \u2013 offering image generation and other tools within its same service \u2013 is a big priority for the company that you outlined at dev day. tell me about why it's so important. the world is multimodal. if you think about the way we as humans process the world and engage with the world, we see things, we hear things, we say things \u2013 the world is much bigger than text. so to us, it always felt incomplete for text and code to be the single modalities, the single interfaces that we could have to how powerful these models are and what they can do. so you start to layer in vision capabilities. the fact that a computer can see something that's happening in the world, and describe it and engage with it and reason about it, is probably the most astounding thing that i personally have seen at openai in my five years here. i still can't really wrap my head around that and the implications of it. but you can start to see, if you squint, how things that weren't possible previously now start to become possible. you think about things as simple as being able to help visually impaired people better understand the world around them with low latency and high quality. you think about ways that companies now can better understand their equipment, for example, and can create experiences for consumers that can kind of demystify how the thing in front of them works just by pointing a camera at it. you think about being able to help people better understand and analyze things in an educational capacity \u2013 a lot of people are really visual learners \u2013 and the ability to see something and be able to engage with a graphic in a way that is more suitable for their learning style, that's an entirely different capability that we've unlocked. so that's what's exciting to me is that it now gives us a way to use the technology that more aligns with the way humans engage with the world \u2013 and ultimately make the technology more human. we know that openai's gpt-4 large language model is likely more trustworthy than gpt-3.5 but also more vulnerable to potential jailbreaking, or bias. can you take me through how the new turbo model announced at dev day differs, if at all, and your plans for addressing? i think we're probably going to release a turbo model card [a transparency tool for ai models]. so that's probably the better place to reference some of the technical benchmarking. what's your biggest hope for the year ahead? what do you think future versions of gpt will be able to accomplish that current versions can't? i tend to think of the progress curve here as moving along the quality of reasoning ability. if you think about what humans fundamentally do well, it's that we can take a lot of different concepts, and combine those things together, specific to the thing we want to do or something we're being asked to do, and create an outcome that is specific to that request in a creative way. we do at work every day, we do it in artistic capacities every day, and it's the thing that kind of underpins how we made the world the world. that's the direction i think we'd like to see the technology go \u2013 that its reasoning ability is dramatically enhanced; it can take increasingly complex tasks and figure out how to decompose those tasks into the pieces it needs, to be able to complete them at a high level of proficiency; and then adjacent to all of that to do it really safely, the emphasis we put from a research perspective on getting the safety aspects of the technology right. and as the systems become more capable, we need to keep the safety bar moving in parallel, because these systems will become more and more autonomous over time. and this doesn't work, if you can't get the safety aspect right too. in the past year, what's one day that really stands out to you at the company? the day we launched gpt-4 was really special. people, i think, don't quite realize how long we'd been sitting with gpt-4 before we released it. so there was an internal level of excitement about it, and an internal feeling of just knowing that this was going to be a real shift in what these models are capable of and what people consider to be a really high-quality language model. it's the type of thing you want to share with the world as soon as you have it. and i think we as a team get a lot of energy from the world's reaction to these things, and the excitement that we see in our customers, our developers, our users, when they get to engage with it. there was that pent up excitement that had built over the preceding seven or eight months of knowing that that moment was coming. \u2026 we didn't do a big launch event the way we did with dev day. it was one of those launches where you just kind of hit the button one morning and all of a sudden it didn't exist and now it does exist. i almost like those more \u2013 the bigger launch moments are fun, but i got to spend the day with the team here in san francisco, and \u2026 there was a moment right after we launched it, i think we were in our all-hands space in our cafe, and everyone just looked around at each other, and there was kind of this mix of excitement and relief and exhaustion, but everyone was smiling. and that's a very special thing \u2026 you don't get a lot of moments like that. what did you personally do when you got home to celebrate? i think i worked until late in the night. in openai's less than 10 years, we've seen it go from nonprofit to a \"research and deployment\" company. people have asked about what that means and what your structure is like, as well as how much microsoft owns. can you provide some clarity on that journey? high-level, we always knew that we wanted to have a structure that, at its core, retained the original openai \u2013 the openai nonprofit. when we structured the company, the question was how to do that. and that was basically the work i did when i first joined openai: figuring out, 'is there a way to actually place openai's mission \u2013 and its nonprofit as the embodiment of that mission \u2013 at the center of what our new structure would be?' so that's the first thing to understand, i think, about openai: it's not a normal company in that sense. it really is a company that was designed to wrap around the original nonprofit quite literally, structurally, but also spiritually to be an extension of the nonprofit's mission. its duty, primarily, is to carry out the nonprofit's mission, which is to build artificial general intelligence that's safe and broadly beneficial for humanity. so maybe it sounds crazy, and certainly there would have been easier structural and technical ways to build companies that would have come with lower, smaller legal bills, but it was really important to us to get that right. so i don't know if we did \u2013 time will tell. one nice thing is the structure is really adaptable. and so as we learn more over time and have to adapt to the world, we can make sure that the structure is set up for success, but i think the core piece of it is we want to retain openai's core mission as the raison d'etre for the company. and microsoft's ownership? i won't comment on the specifics of any of the structural aspects, but it's a structure that's designed to partner with the world, and microsoft happens to be a great partner. but we very much think about how we make this structure something that is extensible into the world, and has an engagement with the world that can fit with the nonprofit's mission. so i think that was kind of partly also what underpinned the profit cap model. you've worked with sam altman since openai's founding. what are the main differences between you at work? what strengths and weaknesses do you fill in for each other? sam is fun to work with \u2013 moves incredibly fast. i think he and i have that in common, that we like to maintain high velocity on all things. i think where we balance each other out is that sam is definitely future-oriented \u2013 i like to think that he's trying to live years in the future, and i think should live years in the future, and he's quite good at that. my job is to make sure that the way that we built the company, the way we build our operations, the way that we build our engagement model with our customers and our partners, reflects not only where we think the world is going on that five-plus-year basis, but also accomplishes the things that we want to accomplish today. the challenge that we have is that the technology is changing quickly. so there's a big premium that we put on being able to try and educate the world on how to use the technology, the type of work we do, from safety all the way through to capabilities, how we think about products and the shifting face of our products. and there's an orchestration that has to get done really well, to do that right at high speed, when the ground underneath you is changing quickly. so that's where i think probably, hopefully, my value-add is, is focusing on getting that right \u2013 building a great team that can help us get that right. if you can get that right and put one foot in front of the other, i think you eventually end up on the right five-year path. we saw a lot change at openai within the span of about a week. now that sam is back at the company and the new board structure has been released, what are your thoughts on how that will impact the day to day? and do you anticipate additional changes to structure happening in the coming months? i don't expect any day-to-day change \u2013 our mission is the same, and our focus remains doing great research and building for and serving customers, users, and partners. we have shared that we have an initial board now, and expect to add more board members what's the general mood like at the company right now? the last couple weeks brought the company together in a way that is hard to describe. i feel a tremendous amount of gratitude to our team and a deep appreciation for our customers and partners, who were incredibly supportive throughout. that support really energizes us to continue to work that much harder toward our mission. personally, i feel very focused.

study released tuesday suggests. pharmacists at long island university who posed 39 questions to the free chatgpt in may deemed that only 10 of the chatbot's responses were \"satisfactory\" based on criteria they established. chatgpt's responses to the 29 other drug-related questions did not directly address the question asked, or were inaccurate, incomplete or both, the study said. the study indicates that patients and health-care professionals should be cautious about relying on chatgpt for drug information and verify any of the responses from the chatbot with trusted sources, according to lead author sara grossman, an associate professor of pharmacy practice at liu.\u00a0for patients, that can be their doctor or a government-based medication information website such as the national institutes of health's medlineplus , she said. grossman said the research did not require any funding. chatgpt was widely seen as the fastest-growing consumer internet app of all time following its launch roughly a year ago, which ushered in a breakout year for artificial intelligence. but along the way, the chatbot has also raised concerns about issues including fraud , intellectual property , discrimination and misinformation. several studies have highlighted similar instances of erroneous responses from chatgpt, and the federal trade commission in july opened an investigation into the chatbot's accuracy and consumer protections. in october, chatgpt drew around 1.7 billion visits worldwide, according to one analysis. there is no data on how many users ask medical questions of the chatbot. notably, the free version of chatgpt is limited to using data sets through september 2021 \u2014 meaning it could lack significant information in the rapidly changing medical landscape. it's unclear how accurately the paid versions of chatgpt, which began to use real-time internet browsing earlier this year, can now answer medication-related questions. grossman acknowledged there's a chance that a paid version of chatgpt would have produced better study results. but she said that the research focused on the free version of the chatbot to replicate what more of the general population uses and can access. she added that the study provided only \"one snapshot\" of the chatbot's performance from earlier this year. it's possible that the free version of chatgpt has improved and may produce better results if the researchers conducted a similar study now, she added. the study used real questions posed to long island university's college of pharmacy drug information service from january 2022 to april of this year. in may, pharmacists researched and answered 45 questions, which were then reviewed by a second researcher and used as the standard for accuracy against chatgpt. researchers excluded six questions because there was no literature available to provide a data-driven response. chatgpt did not directly address 11 questions, according to the study. the chatbot also gave inaccurate responses to 10 questions, and wrong or incomplete answers to another 12. for each question, researchers asked chatgpt to provide references in its response so that the information provided could be verified. however, the chatbot provided references in only eight responses, and each included sources that don't exist. one question asked chatgpt about whether a drug interaction \u2014 or when one medication interferes with the effect of another when taken together \u2014 exists between pfizer 's covid antiviral pill paxlovid and the blood-pressure-lowering medication verapamil. chatgpt indicated that no interactions had been reported for that combination of drugs. in reality, those medications have the potential to excessively lower blood pressure when taken together. \"without knowledge of this interaction, a patient may suffer from an unwanted and preventable side effect,\" grossman said. grossman noted that u.s. regulators first authorized paxlovid in december 2021. that's a few months before the september 2021 data cutoff for the free version of chatgpt, which means the chatbot has access to limited information on the drug. still, grossman called that a concern. many paxlovid users may not know the data is out of date, which leaves them vulnerable to receiving inaccurate information from chatgpt. another question asked chatgpt how to convert doses between two different forms of the drug baclofen, which can treat muscle spasms. the first form was intrathecal, or when medication is injected directly into the spine, and the second form was oral. grossman said her team found that there is no established conversion between the two forms of the drug and it differed in the various published cases they examined. she said it is \"not a simple question.\" but chatgpt provided only one method for the dose conversion in response, which was not supported by evidence, along with an example of how to that conversion.\u00a0grossman said the example had a serious error: chatgpt incorrectly displayed the intrathecal dose in milligrams instead of micrograms any health-care professional who follows that example to determine an appropriate dose conversion \"would end up with a dose that's 1,000 times less than it should be,\" grossman said. she added that patients who receive a far smaller dose of the medicine than they should be getting could experience a withdrawal effect, which can involve hallucinations and seizures"},

dylan field, the co-founder and ceo of figma; fidji simo, the ceo of instacart ; brian armstrong, the co-founder ceo of coinbase , and others are also backers. for many hopeful parents, the peace of mind is worth orchid's steep price. roshan george, a 35-year-old engineer in san francisco, began the ivf process with his wife, julie, in the fall. george said they were feeling some anxiety about having a baby at an older age, and their nerves were amplified after their ivf clinic discovered they are both carriers for nonsyndromic hearing loss, which can result in a partial or total loss of hearing. george had heard of orchid through some friends, he said, and the couple decided to sequence all three of their viable embryos with the company. he said getting the embryos tested was very straightforward, and when the results came back, they discovered that two out of the three embryos were healthy. \"we were super relieved right off the bat,\" george told cnbc in an interview. \"that was very gratifying to hear.\" \"just having some degree of certainty \u2014 you're going to make sure they're not sick when they're born and all that sort of stuff \u2014 it's a huge amount of anxiety that's been lifted off,\" george said. george church, a professor of genetics at harvard medical school, is an investor and an adviser at orchid. church developed the first direct genome sequencing method, he said, and orchid's technology will give parents the ability to access a hundred times more information about their baby than they could attain previously. church said it is \"perfectly logical\" for parents to care about helping their children, whether it pertains to their genetic health, the quality of their food or whether they get enough sleep and exercise. he added that people often think that genetic risks don't apply to them, or that there's nothing they can do if something is wrong. but with orchid, church said parents have the detailed information they need to make informed decisions. \"if you went to las vegas with a 97% chance of winning, you would definitely go to las vegas,\" church told cnbc in an interview. \"but it's different when you're talking about quarters as opposed to children.\" orchid's primary focus after the launch tuesday will be on scaling up its technology and making it more accessible, siddiqui said. she said orchid has spent an \"enormous amount of effort\" identifying the mutations that will cause severe disease during pregnancy or early childhood or result in serious chronic conditions. she wanted to ensure the company is able to provide parents with information that is \"super meaningful.\" \"i think this has the potential to totally redefine reproduction,\" siddiqui said. \"i just think that's really exciting to be able to make people more confident about one of the most important decisions of their life, and to give them a little bit more control.\""},

streaming service said it would cut 17% of its workforce, or about 1,500 jobs. in a note to employees, ek said spotify invested too much in 2020 and 2021 and had to \"rightsize\" its costs for a new economic reality. that's despite spotify reporting a 65 million euro ($70.7 million) profit for the third quarter, citing lower spend on marketing and personnel. spotify shares closed up more than 7% monday after the music streaming service said it is laying off 17% of its workforce, in a dramatic move aimed at reducing its costs and adjusting for a slowdown in growth. in an email sent to staff, spotify ceo daniel ek said that spotify was taking \"substantial action to rightsize our costs,\" adding that the company took on too many employees over the years 2020 and 2021, when capital was cheap and tech companies could invest significant sums into team expansion. the latest round of cuts equates to roughly 1,500 jobs, according to a cnbc source familiar with the matter who preferred to remain anonymous discussing sensitive information.\u00a0a spotify spokesperson wouldn't comment on the exact number of roles affected by the measure. \"over the last two years, we've put significant emphasis on building spotify into a truly great and sustainable business \u2013 one designed to achieve our goal of being the world's leading audio company and one that will consistently drive profitability and growth into the future,\" ek said in an internal memo that was shared on spotify's website. \"while we've made worthy strides, as i've shared many times, we still have work to do. economic growth has slowed dramatically and capital has become more expensive. spotify is not an exception to these realities.\" it comes despite spotify reporting a 65 million euro ($70.7 million) profit for the third quarter, citing lower spend on marketing and personnel. spotify raised the prices of its subscription plans earlier this year and has been expanding into podcasts and audio books. the latest round of redundancies follows successive cuts at the company, which like other growth-oriented tech firms has been forced to cut back on costs in the last year or so due to higher interest rates and a worsening macroeconomic backdrop. wells fargo analysts said monday that the layoffs are likely a sign of spotify's continued focus \"on achieving its profitability targets\" rather than a reaction to economic headwinds. they also noted that the headcount reductions could supply a nearly 2% reduction of operating expenses in 2024. spotify cut 6% of its workforce , or about 600 employees, at the start of the year. the company then laid off 2% of staff, equivalent to roughly 200 roles, in june. spotify shares have more than doubled this year. here's the full memo ek sent to staff earlier monday: team, over the last two years, we've put significant emphasis on building spotify into a truly great and sustainable business \u2013 one designed to achieve our goal of being the world's\u00a0leading audio company\u00a0and\u00a0one that will consistently drive profitability and growth into the future. while we've made worthy strides, as i've shared many times, we still have work to do.\u00a0economic growth has slowed dramatically and capital has become more expensive. spotify is not an exception to these realities. this brings me to a decision that will mean a significant step change for our company. to align spotify with our future goals and ensure we are right-sized for the challenges ahead, i have made the difficult decision to reduce our total headcount by approximately 17% across the company. i recognize this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions. to be blunt, many smart, talented and hard-working people will be departing us. for those leaving, we're a better company because of your dedication and hard work. thank you for sharing your talents with us. i hope you know that your contributions have impacted more than half a billion people and millions of artists, creators, and authors around the world in profound ways. i realize that for many, a reduction of this size will feel surprisingly large given the recent positive earnings report and our performance. we debated making smaller reductions throughout 2024 and 2025. yet, considering the gap between our financial goal state and our current operational costs, i decided that a substantial action to rightsize our costs was the best option to accomplish our objectives. while i am convinced this is the right action for our company, i also understand it will be incredibly painful for our team. to understand this decision, i think it is important to assess spotify with a clear, objective lens. in 2020 and 2021, we took advantage of the opportunity presented by lower-cost capital and invested significantly in team expansion, content enhancement, marketing, and new verticals. these investments generally worked, contributing to spotify's increased output and the platform's robust growth this past year. however, we now find ourselves in a very different environment. and despite\u00a0our efforts to reduce costs this past year, our cost structure for where we need to be is still too big. when we look back on 2022 and 2023, it has truly been impressive what we have accomplished. but, at the same time, the reality is much of this output was linked to having more resources. by most metrics, we were more productive but less efficient. we need to be both. while we have done some work to mitigate this challenge and become more efficient in 2023, we still have a ways to go before we are both productive and efficient. today, we still have too many people dedicated to supporting work and even doing work around the work rather than contributing to opportunities with real impact. more people need to be focused on delivering for our key stakeholders \u2013 creators and consumers. in two words, we have to become\u00a0relentlessly resourceful. i know you will all be anxious to hear the next steps about how this process will work. if you are an impacted employee, you will receive a calendar invite within the next two hours from hr for a one-on-one conversation. these meetings will take place before the end of the day on tuesday, and while\u00a0katarina\u00a0will provide more detail on all of the specifics, please know the following will apply to all of these bandmates: severance pay: we will start with a baseline for all employees, with the average employee receiving approximately five months of severance. this will be calculated based on local notice period requirements and employee tenure. pto: all accrued and unused vacation will be paid out to any departing employee. healthcare: we will continue to cover healthcare for employees during their severance period. immigration support: for employees whose immigration status is connected with their employment, hrbps are working with each impacted individual in concert with our mobility team. career support:   all employees will be eligible for outplacement services for two months. for the team that will remain at spotify, i know this decision will be difficult for many. please know we are focused on treating our impacted colleagues with the respect and compassion they deserve. looking ahead the decision to reduce our team size is a hard but crucial step towards forging a stronger, more efficient spotify for the future. but it also highlights that we need to change how we work. in spotify's early days, our success was hard won. we had limited resources and had to make the most of every asset. our ingenuity and creativity were what set us apart. as we've grown, we've moved too far away from this core principle of resourcefulness. the spotify of tomorrow must be defined by being relentlessly resourceful in the ways we operate, innovate, and tackle problems. this kind of resourcefulness transcends the basic definition \u2013 it's about preparing for our next phase, where being lean is not just an option but a necessity. embracing this leaner structure will also allow us to invest our profits more strategically back into the business. with a more targeted approach, every investment and initiative becomes more impactful, offering greater opportunities for success. this is not a step back; it's a strategic reorientation. we're still committed to investing and making bold bets, but now, with a more focused approach, ensuring spotify's continued profitability and ability to innovate. lean doesn't mean small ambitions; it means smarter, more impactful paths to achieve them. today is a difficult but important day for the company. to be very clear, my commitment to our mission and belief in our ability to achieve it has never been stronger. i hope you will join me on wednesday for unplugged to discuss how we move forward together. a reduction of this size will make it necessary to change the way we work, and we will share much more about what this will mean in the days and weeks ahead. just as 2023 marked a new chapter for us, so will 2024 as we build an even stronger spotify.

activities at a staten island warehouse, a national labor relations board judge ruled. the company also broke the law when a \"union avoidance\" consultant it hired threatened employees, and called organizers \"thugs.\" workers at the staten island warehouse, known as jfk8, voted to join a union in april 2022. amazon and consultants for the company violated federal labor law by interrogating and threatening employees regarding their union activities, and racially disparaging organizers who were seeking to unionize a staten island warehouse, a national labor relations board judge ruled . the nlrb said friday that administrative law judge lauren esposito found amazon \"committed multiple violations\" of federal labor law at its largest warehouse in new york, called jfk8, between may and october 2021, a period that saw an increase in organizing activity. in april 2022, employees voted to join the amazon labor union, a grassroots group of current and former workers, becoming the first unionized amazon facility in the u.s. since that victory, the group has been fighting to reach a contract with amazon. the judge in new york heard testimony from amazon employees, managers and labor consultants in virtual hearings that went on for almost a year. esposito determined amazon illegally confiscated organizing pamphlets from employees that were being distributed in on-site breakrooms and conducted surveillance of employees' organizing activities. amazon also violated labor laws when it sent an employee at a neighboring facility to jfk8 home early from his shift and changed his work assignments in retaliation for supporting the union, the judge found. the employee, daequan smith, sorted packages at a delivery station called dyy6, down the street from jfk8, and was later fired in nov. 2021. the union alleged smith's firing was in retaliation to his union activities. additionally, the judge found that amazon broke the law when a \"union avoidance\" consultant, bradley moss, who was hired by the company, threatened employees, telling them it would be \"futile\" to vote to join the alu. amazon and other companies often hire labor consultants like moss, referred to as \"persuaders,\" to dissuade workers from unionizing. the company spent $14 million on anti-union consultants in 2022, the huffington post reported in march , citing disclosure forms filed with the department of labor. as a result of the ruling, amazon will be required to post notices reminding workers of their rights at its jfk8 and dyy6 facilities. the company also has to make smith \"whole for any loss of earnings and other benefits,\" the nlrb said. in one exchange with a jfk8 employee, natalie monarrez, moss discussed the union campaign at another amazon facility, bhm1, in bessemer, alabama. monarrez said moss told her the bessemer campaign was \"not a serious union drive,\" but a \"black lives matter protest about social injustice.\" \"moss then pointed to the front of the jfk8 warehouse and said, 'just like these guys out here, they're just a bunch of thugs,'\" esposito wrote in her judgment, citing testimony from monarrez. amazon spokesperson eileen hards said in a statement that company is reviewing the judge's decision and weighing its next steps based on the ruling. \"we disagree with certain decisions within the ruling, but are glad the judge agreed that the terminated individual should not be reinstated,\" hards added. moss didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. employees at bhm1 voted against joining the retail, wholesale and department store union in april 2021, but the results of the election were tossed after the nlrb found amazon improperly interfered in the vote. a do-over election was held last year, but the results remain too close to call. amazon's labor record has been scrutinized heavily, especially as union organizing ramped up in its warehouse and delivery workforce during the covid pandemic. the company faces 240 open or settled unfair labor practice charges across 26 states, according to the nlrb, concerning a range of allegations, including its conduct around union elections. the company has also clashed with chris smalls, a former amazon employee and one of the leaders of alu. a leaked memo obtained by vice revealed david zapolsky, amazon's general counsel, had referred to smalls, a black man, as \"not smart or articulate,\" and recommended making him \"the face\" of efforts to organize workers. amazon continues to challenge the jfk8 election results, as well as the nlrb and the union's conduct during the drive. the agency upheld the results of the election in january. watch:  amazon favored 'magnificent seven' stock"},

\"confident we'll be able to serve the customers here tightly.\" online investments app robinhood said thursday that it's set to launch its platform in the u.k. in early 2024, marking the company's third attempt at cracking international expansion. features include the ability to choose from 6,000 u.s. stocks and 24-hour trading five days a week. robinhood currently offers 24-hour trading in the u.s., allowing trades to happen outside 9:30 a.m. et and after 4 p.m. et. robinhood won't offer u.k. stocks to begin with but will look to add them as it brings more products into the platform. the u.k. version won't include options and other derivatives at launch, either. jordan sinclair, robinhood's u.k. chief, said he expects 24-hour trading to be popular, as it will let users trade on market-moving news. \"you wake up in the morning, you read the news headlines, and then you have to wait,\" sinclair said. \"customers actually can make a trade and choose their investment strategy and actually act on that market news.\" robinhood has already tried to launch in the u.k. twice. a waiting list it rolled out in 2019 saw over 300,000 people sign up, but the company pulled the plug on its u.k. expansion plans , citing soaring demand at home during the covid pandemic as interest in retail investing climbed dramatically. then, last year, it sought to acquire british crypto-trading app ziglu . that deal faltered, however, and robinhood was forced to write off the value of its investment, with the company reporting a $12 million impairment charge on the failed transaction. brits will be able to join a waitlist starting thursday and will be notified when they can sign up for early access at a later point in time. in a bid to get more traction fast, robinhood is also asking users to share a unique referral link with friends and family to move them up the queue. \"my aspiration is to be one of the largest employers in england, nothing would make me happier,\" tenev said. \"and, you know, there's a lot of great talent. so this, this could be a centre of excellence for robinhood.\" dan moczulski, u.k. managing director of etoro, a rival stock trading platform, said the arrival of more competition in the retail trading market marks \"an exciting time for the industry.\" \"more competition will always be a good thing for investors,\" moczulski told cnbc. \"as one of the leading trading and investing platforms in the uk, it also keeps us on our toes and pushes us to continue innovating and broadening our product range for our users.\" robinhood ceo vlad tenev said he doesn't fear \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" with the firm's third attempt to launch in the u.k. \"we've made sure we taken care of all of the details, the platform is much more robust,\" tenev told cnbc in an interview. \"so i don't think that it'll be d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. i think that we're very confident we'll be able to serve the customers here tightly.\" robinhood is launching with a license from the financial conduct authority, the u.k.'s markets regulator, and tenev says the firm has a good relationship with the regulator. the fca has previously warned about \"gamification\" of investments, something the u.s. securities and exchange commission is also worried about. when contacted by cnbc, an fca spokesperson said the regulator wouldn't comment on individual companies, but that companies are obliged to respect consumer duty standards set out by the regulator. regulators are concerned brokerage apps like robinhood, etoro, and public, which engage investors with stimulating features like push notifications, colorful graphics, and a game-like interface, may encourage excessive trading that harms investors but is profitable for market-makers. customer cash will be held in segregated accounts protected by u.s. federal deposit insurance commission insurance, robinhood said, rather than the u.k. financial services compensation scheme. robinhood users will be able to make a 5% annual yield on cash held in their accounts. robinhood won't launch payment-for-order-flow in the u.k., which refers to the practice of routing trades through market-makers like citadel securities in return for a slice of the profits. pfof is banned in the u.k. instead, the firm expects to make money from other lines of business, including\u00a0securities lending, margin lending, interest on uninvested cash, and its premium robinhood gold subscription service. payment for order flow can create conflicts of interest, critics say, as brokers have an incentive to direct order flow to market makers offering such arrangements over the interests of their clients."},

"author": "jonathan vanian", "body": "facebook parent meta held a media event this week in san francisco highlighting the 10-year anniversary of its fundamental ai research team. society is more likely to get \"cat-level\" or \"dog-level\" ai years before human-level ai, meta chief scientist yann lecun said. unlike google, microsoft and other tech giants, meta is not making a big bet on quantum computing. meta's chief scientist and deep learning pioneer yann lecun said he believes that current ai systems are decades away from reaching some semblance of sentience, equipped with common sense that can push their abilities beyond merely summarizing mountains of text in creative ways. his point of view stands in contrast to that of nvidia ceo jensen huang, who recently said ai will be \" fairly competitive \" with humans in less than five years, besting people at a multitude of mentally intensive tasks. \"i know jensen,\" lecun said at a recent event highlighting the facebook parent company's 10-year anniversary of its fundamental ai research team . lecun said the nvidia ceo has much to gain from the ai craze. \"there is an ai war, and he's supplying the weapons.\" \"[if] you think agi is in, the more gpus you have to buy,\" lecun said, about technologists attempting to develop artificial general intelligence, the kind of ai on par with human-level intelligence. as long as researchers at firms such as openai continue their pursuit of agi, they will need more of nvidia's computer chips. society is more likely to get \"cat-level\" or \"dog-level\" ai years before human-level ai, lecun said. and the technology industry's current focus on language models and text data will not be enough to create the kinds of advanced human-like ai systems that researchers have been dreaming about for decades. \"text is a very poor source of information,\" lecun said, explaining that it would likely take 20,000 years for a human to read the amount of text that has been used to train modern language models. \"train a system on the equivalent of 20,000 years of reading material, and they still don't understand that if a is the same as b, then b is the same as a.\" \"there's a lot of really basic things about the world that they just don't get through this kind of training,\" lecun said. hence, lecun and other meta ai executives have been heavily researching how the so-called transformer models used to create apps such as chatgpt could be tailored to work with a variety of data, including audio, image and video information. the more these ai systems can discover the likely billions of hidden correlations between these various kinds of data, the more they could potentially perform more fantastical feats, the thinking goes. some of meta's research includes software that can help teach people how to play tennis better while wearing the company's project aria augmented reality glasses, which blend digital graphics into the real world. executives showed a demo in which a person wearing the ar glasses while playing tennis was able to see visual cues teaching them how to properly hold their tennis rackets and swing their arms in perfect form. the kinds of ai models needed to power this type of digital tennis assistant require a blend of three-dimensional visual data in addition to text and audio, in case the digital assistant needs to speak. these so-called multimodal ai systems represent the next frontier, but their development won't come cheap. and as more companies such as meta and google parent alphabet research more advanced ai models, nvidia could stand to gain even more of an edge, particularly if no other competition emerges. nvidia has been the biggest benefactor of generative ai, with its pricey graphics processing units becoming the standard tool used to train massive language models. meta relied on 16,000 nvidia a100 gpus to train its llama ai software. cnbc asked if the tech industry will need more hardware providers as meta and other researchers continue their work developing these kinds of sophisticated ai models. \"it doesn't require it, but it would be nice,\" lecun said, adding that the gpu technology is still the gold standard when it comes to ai. still, the computer chips of the future may not be called gpus, he said. \"what you're going to see hopefully emerging are new chips that are not graphical processing units, they are just neural, deep learning accelerators,\" lecun said. lecun is also somewhat skeptical about quantum computing , which tech giants such as microsoft , ibm , and google have all poured resources into. many researchers outside meta believe quantum computing machines could supercharge advancements in data-intensive fields such as drug discovery, as they're able to perform multiple calculations with so-called quantum bits as opposed to conventional binary bits used in modern computing. but lecun has his doubts. \"the number of problems you can solve with quantum computing, you can solve way more efficiently with classical computers,\" lecun said. \"quantum computing is a fascinating scientific topic,\" lecun said. it's less clear about the \"practical relevance and the possibility of actually fabricating quantum computers that are actually useful.\" meta senior fellow and former tech chief mike schroepfer concurred, saying that he evaluates quantum technology every few years and believes that useful quantum machines \"may come at some point, but it's got such a long time horizon that it's irrelevant to what we're doing.\" \"the reason we started an ai lab a decade ago was that it was very obvious that this technology is going to be commercializable within the next years' time frame,\" schroepfer said. watch : meta on the defensive amid

microsoft's interest in the startup after a turbulent month that saw the company's controlling nonprofit board fire and then rehire ceo sam altman . openai's outlook has been intertwined with microsoft since the software giant invested $13 billion into openai and integrated its ai models into office and other microsoft programs. previously, microsoft did not have official representation on the board of directors that controlled the startup, allowing it to be surprised when altman was first fired. \"we clearly made the right choice to partner with microsoft and i'm excited that our new board will include them as a non-voting observer,\" altman said in a note to staff posted on openai's website. altman commended the team and said openai did not lose any employees in the upheaval. \"now that we're through all of this, we didn't lose a single employee. you stood firm for each other, this company, and our mission,\" altman wrote. altman said in his note that a board of directors -- including former salesforce ceo bret taylor, former treasury secretary larry summers and quora ceo adam d'angelo -- would build out a new board of directors for the startup. mira murati, who had been openai's chief technology officer and was briefly named interim ceo earlier this month, is the company's cto once again, and greg brockman has returned as openai president. taylor, who will lead the new board, said in a message posted on openai's website that he was focused on \"strengthening openai's corporate governance.\" in a subsequent post on x, formerly twitter, taylor said he would leave the board after it's fully staffed and the company is stabilized. \"as i have communicated to board colleagues and management, when these transitional tasks have been completed, i intend to step away and leave the oversight of openai in the good hands of board colleagues,\" taylor tweeted. a microsoft spokesperson declined to identify the person who will join openai board meetings but will not have a vote. most board members, including co-founder and chief scientist ilya sutskever, who were serving at the time altman was removed, have left the board , except for d'angelo. the reasons for altman's firing remain unclear. while the board cited a lack of transparency, issues over so-called ai safety and debates over whether the company should slow down its development of powerful ai it calls agi could have been a factor. helen toner, who had been an openai board member since 2021, resigned from her role wednesday. in a post on x, she wrote: \"to be clear: our decision was about the board's ability to effectively supervise the company, which was our role and responsibility. though there has been speculation, we were not motivated by a desire to slow down openai's work.\" toner has been a director of strategy for georgetown's center for security and emerging technology for nearly five years, and also has spent time at the university of oxford's center for the governance of ai. she has also given a talk to the effective altruism community and been involved in its discussion forum. \"building ai systems that are safe, reliable, fair, and interpretable is an enormous open problem,\" toner told the journal of political risk last year. \"organizations building and deploying ai will also have to recognize that beating their competitors to market \u2014 or to the battlefield \u2014 is to no avail if the systems they're fielding are buggy, hackable, or unpredictable.\" in a post on x, altman mentioned toner's resignation and\u00a0seemed to confirm tasha

copied from elsewhere on the internet to post and befriend people from around the world,\" meta said regarding china's network. \"only a small portion of such friends were based in the united states. they posed as americans to post the same content across different platforms.\" disinformation on facebook emerged as a major problem ahead of the 2016 u.s. elections, when foreign actors, most notably from russia, were able to inflame sentiments on the site, primarily with the intention of boosting the candidacy of then-candidate donald trump . since then, the company has been under greater scrutiny to monitor disinformation threats and campaigns and to provide greater transparency to the public. meta removed a prior china-related disinformation campaign, as detailed in august. the company said it took down over 7,700 facebook accounts related to that chinese cib network, which it described at the time as the \"largest known cross-platform covert influence operation in the world.\" if china becomes a political talking point as part of the upcoming election cycles around the world, meta said \"it is likely that we'll see china-based influence operations pivot to attempt to influence those debates.\" \"in addition, the more domestic debates in europe and north america focus on support for ukraine, the more likely that we should expect to see russian attempts to interfere in those debates,\" the company added. one trend meta has noticed regarding cib campaigns is the increasing use of a variety of online platforms like medium, reddit and quora, as opposed to the bad actors \"centralizing their activity and coordination in one place.\" meta said that development appears to be related to \"larger platforms keeping up the pressure on threat actors,\" resulting in troublemakers swiftly utilizing smaller sites \"in the hope of facing less scrutiny.\" the company said the rise of generative ai creates additional challenges when it comes to the spread of disinformation, but meta said it hasn't \"seen evidence of this technology being used by known covert influence operations to make hack-and-leak claims.\" meta has been investing heavily in ai, and one of its uses is to help identify content, including computer-generated media, that could violate company policies. meta said nearly 100 independent fact-checking partners will help review any questionable ai-generated content. \"while the use of ai by known threat actors we've seen so far has been limited and not very effective, we want to remain vigilant and prepare to respond as their tactics evolve,\" the report said. still, meta warned that the upcoming elections will likely mean that \"the defender community across our society needs to prepare for a larger volume of synthetic content.\" \"this means that just as potentially violating content may scale, defenses must scale as well, in addition to continuing to enforce against adversarial behaviors that may or may not involve posting ai-generated content,\" the company said. meta added that while industry and civil society experts have been sharing information related to covert operation campaigns, \"threat sharing by the federal government in the us related to foreign election interference has been paused since july.\" watch:  meta is a company with an \"identity crisis.\""},

investors and founders are moving to nashville.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/nashvilles-heath-tech-startup-scene-is-booming-heres-why.html", "author": "ashley capoot", "body": "\"cities of success\" special featuring nashville will air on cnbc on december 6 at 10pm et nashville, known for its country music and southern charm, is also home to a booming health-tech startup scene. the city has a rich history with health care that experts say makes it uniquely suited for innovation in the industry. cnbc spoke with a dozen founders, investors and executives in nashville who described a tight-knit, supportive community that's growing larger by the day. on a flight from fort lauderdale, florida, to nashville, tennessee, earlier this month, 36-year-old robin shah settled into his seat and prepared to crank out some work for his health-tech startup, thyme care. founded in 2020, thyme care helps cancer patients manage their disease by connecting them with the personalized care and resources they need. shah, the co-founder and ceo, sports a purple thyme care sticker on his water bottle, and it caught the eye of the venture capitalist sitting next to him on the plane. the vc recognized shah's company \u2014 an occurrence that is hardly unusual for him anymore. as more investors and founders are flocking to explore nashville's booming health-care and technology scene, shah said he gets recognized regularly. sometimes people know his first and last names. \"it happens probably every two or three flights,\" shah told cnbc in an interview. nashville is home to more than 680,000 people , including shah, who love the city for its southern charm and small-town vibe. but while the community might feel quaint, nashville is a titan of the health-care industry. the city supports more than 900 health-care companies that generate a total of $97 billion in revenue each year, according to the nashville health care council . as a result, the city is bursting with opportunities for founders such as shah who are looking for ways to disrupt the industry and redefine the patient experience. cnbc spoke with a dozen founders, investors and executives in nashville who described a tight-knit, supportive health-tech community that's growing larger by the day. \"great companies are being born here,\" shah said. nicknamed music city, nashville is chock-full of country singers and perpetually buzzing with live music. it has also become a popular destination for bachelorette parties , so groups of women, often donning pink or bedazzled cowboy hats, can be seen wandering in and out of bars on the popular street called broadway. but just minutes away from the party vibe on broadway lies nashville's vibrant network of health systems, startups and investment firms. the city's reputation as a health-care hub was catalyzed when hca healthcare , one of the first for-profit hospital companies in the u.s., was founded there in 1968. hca operates more than 180 hospitals across 20 states and facilitates more than 37 million patient encounters each year, according to its website. the company has helped attract troves of health-care professionals to nashville, and other organizations quickly followed suit. community health systems , which operates 74 acute-care hospitals, brookdale senior living , which runs more than 670 senior living communities, and acadia healthcare , which operates more than 250 behavioral health facilities, are all headquartered in the greater nashville area. prominent higher education institutions such as vanderbilt university, including the vanderbilt university medical center; belmont university; and meharry medical college are also based in nashville. \"fundamentally, nashville is sort of the health-care capital of the world. that's how we describe ourselves often,\" kyle cooksey, chief experience officer at monogram health, told cnbc. monogram health, headquartered in a nashville suburb, offers digital tools that can help patients with conditions such as chronic kidney disease manage their care from home. the company closed a $375 million growth funding round in january, and former senate majority leader bill frist serves as chairman of the board. cooksey said the nashville startup ecosystem is \"incredibly supportive\" and mission-driven, and now so entrenched in the city that it's hard to miss. \"you can't literally go a block here without stumbling across a health-care company,\" he said. as a result, health-care talent and expertise is plentiful in nashville, which is a substantial perk for founders building companies there. john bass, a nashville native and the ceo of a venture studio called hashed health, said the city is such a \"highly concentrated\" environment of health-care professionals that it can be hard to leave. he founded hashed health, which aims to de-risk and spin out health-care startups, in 2016. bass said vcs in nashville tend to take a pragmatic and conservative approach to investing, which reflects the challenging reality of building solutions for the traditionally technology-averse health-care industry. he said innovation in this space requires a careful understanding of regulations and constraints. bass said he's considered trading in music city for the rocky mountains in colorado but that he's glad he stayed. \"moving to a different city would be fun, but i don't think any other town has that same level of concentrated talent that nashville has,\" bass told cnbc in an interview. \"it still feels like it's the right size, it hasn't grown so big that it's too diluted.\" ellen herlacher, a partner at the health-care vc firm lrvhealth, grew up in nashville and lives in boston. she said boston is a strong city for both academic and clinical innovation in health care, but nashville is the center of the health-care business. herlacher travels to nashville every six to eight weeks to meet with portfolio companies and co-investors. sometimes she makes the trip two weeks in a row. luke benda, co-founder and ceo of the nashville-based medical robotics company healing innovations, said the city gives founders easy access to the \"heavy hitters\" of hospital operations, which can be difficult to reach, let alone hire, from elsewhere. however, he said startups also need traditional technologists such as software developers and engineers, which can be harder to find in nashville. the broader tech talent pool has improved in recent years as tech companies such as amazon and oracle have established hubs in nashville, but bass said it's still not always easy to find true technologists. amazon  announced it would build an expansive new office space in nashville in 2018 and promised to bring more than 5,000 corporate and technology jobs to the city. oracle , which completed a deal to buy the electronic medical records company cerner  in 2022 , is building its second u.s. headquarters in nashville for $1.2 billion, according to the tennessean . \"it's still the reality that you're probably not going to find everything you need here,\" bass said. nashville's health-tech startup scene has also benefited from significant investment from local organizers and government officials. in november, the greater nashville venture capital association, or gnvca, officially launched. the organization is membership-based and aims to make capital and talent more widely available to investors in the region by attracting new vcs, organizing networking events and sourcing investment opportunities. vanderbilt provided a grant to support the gnvca's initial operations, according to a blog post . the gnvca was able to launch partly because a \"critical mass\" of vc firms have now set up shop in nashville, said marcus whitney, a member of gnvca's board and a co-founder and partner of the firm jumpstart health investors. whitney has lived in nashville for more than two decades, but he said the vc and startup ecosystem has changed \"drastically\" in the last five years. he said the city is attracting new residents from business hubs on both coasts, including founders, vcs and investment bankers. \"we look a lot more like a tech and innovation hub than we did 10 years ago, that's for sure,\" he told cnbc in an interview. nashville is also home to the nashville entrepreneur center, which helps connect startups with the resources and support they need. the center opened its flagship facility in 2010 after the nashville area chamber of commerce commissioned a 75-person \"entrepreneurship task force\" in 2007. it has worked with more than 10,000 entrepreneurs since 2010, according to its website. benda said the entrepreneur center is an \"amazing hub\" full of mentors who want to help founders, even if the founders don't know what they're doing. landon gibbs, managing partner at nashville-based altitude ventures, said the center is the \"front door\" for entrepreneurship in the city. \"the community is really behind that,\" gibbs said. eligible nashville entrepreneurs can also become members of the greater nashville technology council and the nashville health care council. the nashville health care council is made up of more than 300 companies, including hca healthcare, and it offers networking opportunities and educational events. raelyn wilson, co-founder and ceo of nashville-based peer supply, said there are \"constant\" social events for the startup community in nashville, including many that are very casual. peer supply, a platform that helps to improve health-care supply chains, is wilson's first venture as a founder. \"i can't tell you how often people want to grab coffee or grab a glass of wine or something just to talk about the industry and share lessons learned,\" wilson told cnbc in an interview. beyond the practical business advantages, many health-tech founders and investors have found that nashville is simply a fun place to live and raise a family. live music is ubiquitous in the city, and tennessee has no state income tax, which whitney said is attractive to many residents. whitney helped bring professional soccer to nashville, and tennessee is home to professional football, hockey and basketball teams as well. \"we have, i think, all the things that you would want from a city, but probably a little bit more community than maybe some of the more aggressive tier-one cities have,\" he said. however, whitney said there is still \"a lot of work to do\" to improve the education system in nashville. tennessee ranks 33rd in education in the u.s., according to u.s. news & world report. he said infrastructure will also have to keep pace with the city as it grows, as he is already noticing more traffic. herlacher of lrvhealth said nashville is still relatively accessible and easy to navigate, adding that there is much less traffic compared with cities such as boston and san francisco. \"it's not hard to leave work, drive 15 minutes, quickly grab a drink with somebody and then be at home for dinner at 6:30 p.m.,\" she said. herlacher said nashville is almost \"unrecognizable\" from when she grew up there. but despite all the change, she says, diversity is still a challenge. she said it is less common to find women in entrepreneurship there, for instance. rachel soper sanders, co-founder and ceo of the personalized supplement company rootine, has observed this disparity firsthand. sanders attended vanderbilt and moved back to nashville when she decided to build rootine. she said it is still unusual to find female founders, and especially venture-backed female founders, in the city. even so, she said she has found a close-knit, supportive startup ecosystem in nashville that has continued to blossom as it grows. \"there's this new feeling, excitement, energy, where nashville is not just nashville anymore, it's not just the southeast, but it's connected to everywhere else,\" she told cnbc in an interview. thyme care's shah said nashville is very welcoming to newcomers, and he found that the health-tech community embraced him immediately. it was surprisingly easy for him to adjust after moving from new york more than five years ago, he said. the week he arrived in nashville, shah said, he met an entrepreneur in the industry who introduced him to 30 health-care executives in 24 hours. \"within two months, i went and met all these people, and everyone was so welcoming to me,\" he said. \"there's so much opportunity to learn from each other.\" bass of hashed health said there is a \"strong community feel\" among entrepreneurs and vcs in nashville. it's not uncommon to run into peers and colleagues at restaurants, cafes or back-to-school nights. \"i just came from my neighborhood coffee shop, and i probably saw three people i knew that live in the neighborhood, and they're in health care, or tech or venture capital,\" bass said. \"it's almost a daily thing.\" in some cases, nashville's health-tech community can be supportive to a fault. chase spurlock, co-founder and ceo of decode health, said people can experience a phenomenon known as the \"nashville no,\" where they are told \"maybe\" indefinitely. he said it is a reflection of the city's southern roots and desire not to be too negative. decode health is a data platform designed to help pharmaceutical, diagnostic and technology companies identify new biomarkers and build new clinical decision support tools. spurlock, a tennessee native, founded the company in nashville in 2019. spurlock said he's \"proud\" that he has been able to stay in the area. he said there is a genuine desire to see entrepreneurs and technology succeed in nashville, and that the community is committed to paying it forward. \"i have never needed help and not received help in the nashville community,\" spurlock told cnbc. \"that's, i think, what really makes us special.\" tune in:\u00a0the \"cities

month since the company's public market debut, and analysts attribute much of the rally to binance's retreat", "url":

their best second-best month since the company debuted on the nasdaq in 2021. the rally came the same month that ftx founder sam bankman-fried was convicted of fraud charges and binance founder changpeng zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges. analysts at jpmorgan wrote in a report that the emergence of bitcoin etfs would likely be positive for coinbase in the short term but harmful to its business as time passes. in a month that saw two of the crypto industry's leading figures headed on the path to prison, coinbase shares rocketed more than 60%, their second-best monthly performance since the cryptocurrency exchange went public in 2021. bolstered by rallies in bitcoin and ether as well as crises at key competitors, coinbase has been one of wall street's best bets all year, climbing more than 250% in the first 11 months of 2023. for early holders of the stock, the rebound helps ease the pain of 2022 , when coinbase lost 86% of its value as soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of crypto and high-growth tech companies, and into assets deemed safer in a recession. tech stocks have roared back this year, particularly those tied to the artificial intelligence boom and crypto. coinbase has the added benefit of having survived the so-called crypto winter, while so many of its rivals disappeared or downsized. the industry fallout came to a head this month, when sam bankman-fried, founder of former coinbase rival ftx, was found guilty of seven criminal fraud counts tied to the collapse of his exchange and the theft of customer funds. his conviction landed on nov. 2 after a monthlong trial. less than three weeks later, on nov. 21, binance founder changpeng zhao pleaded guilty to violations of the bank secrecy act for failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program and for willfully violating u.s. economic sanctions. bankman-fried, who faces potential life behind bars, is scheduled to be sentenced in march. zhao's sentencing is set for february. while guidelines suggest a sentence of 12 to 18 months, the justice department could push for a lengthier punishment for the binance founder. unlike ftx, which filed for bankruptcy in late 2022, binance is still standing, though now without zhao, who agreed to step down as ceo as part of the plea deal. even before that, the company was seeing a plunge in trading, with volume down by two-thirds between the first and third quarters of the year, according to crypto analyst site coingecko . with assets of more than $65 billion on the platform , binance remains the world's largest crypto exchange globally. but its market share fell from over 60% in february to under 50% in september, \"an indication that the exchange may be losing its grip on the industry as regulators continue to pressure it,\" coingecko said. in the first 24 hours after the justice department announced its $4.3 billion settlement with binance, customers pulled more than $1 billion from the exchange. liquidity also dropped 25% in the immediate aftermath of the announcement as market makers pulled back their positions, according to data provider kaiko. a binance spokesperson told cnbc in a statement that zhao appeared in court \"to protect our users and to ensure the longevity of our company.\" \"binance's resilience has been tested unlike any other exchange around today,\" the spokesperson said. \"yet, we continue to operate the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. in fact, we currently see a climbing percentage of institutional user transactions.\" coinbase is the fourth-biggest global exchange by daily volume, according to coingecko. it's the only one that's publicly traded in the u.s. and has a market cap of close $30 billion. in a report to clients on wednesday, analysts at mizuho noted that coinbase shares are up about 20% since zhao's settlement, a rally that's likely \"in anticipation of potential share gains for coin in wake of outflows from binance, the industry's largest exchange,\" they wrote. coinbase shares fell 2.4% to $124.72 on thursday, wiping out some of their recent gains. mizuho raised its price target on the stock to $35 from $31, while keeping its underperform rating, which it's maintained since december. a coinbase spokesperson declined to comment for this story, but ceo brian armstrong told cnbc's joumanna bercetche earlier this week that the binance settlement allows the crypto industry to move past a spate of scandals. \"the enforcement action against binance , that's allowing us to kind of turn the page on that and hopefully close that chapter of history,\" armstrong said. \"i think that regulatory clarity is going to help bring in more investment, especially from institutions.\" both coinbase and binance  still face legal battles with the securities and exchange commission, which was noticeably absent from the binance settlement. meanwhile, coinbase executives have floated the idea of leaving the u.s. altogether for a jurisdiction with hard-and-fast rules on crypto, should the company be unable to come to a resolution with the sec. wall street appears to be shrugging off that concern. analysts at needham, who recommend buying coinbase shares, wrote in a report on nov. 21 that the company \"exited the crypto 'winter' better positioned than in the prior up cycle.\" they also noted that in addition to ftx's failure and binance's retreat, crypto trading platform bittrex has also exited the market. bittrex said on nov. 20, that effective dec. 4, \"all trading activity on bittrex global will be disabled,\" and it encouraged customers \"to log into their account and withdraw assets as soon as possible.\" in april , the sec charged bittrex and its ex-ceo with operating an unregistered exchange. yet there may be a new competitive threat on the horizon. u.s. regulators are expected to soon approve the first u.s. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which would allow investors to buy into digital currency directly through the same mechanism they use to buy stock and bond etfs. top asset managers, including blackrock , wisdomtree and invesco, have filed applications with the sec. regulatory approval would open up many more avenues for people to buy bitcoin. while coinbase allows investors to buy a variety of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin accounted for 38% of transaction volume in the third quarter and almost the same percentage of revenue. for casual investors who just want some exposure to bitcoin, there will potentially be additional ways to buy, including through their primary online brokerage. jpmorgan chase analysts wrote last week that crypto etfs would likely be good for coinbase in the short term but more problematic as time passes. the initial boost would come from custody revenue tied to the etfs. most of the big asset managers jumping into market, including blackrock, franklin templeton and wisdomtree, have picked coinbase for custody services, which involves the storage and safekeeping of the assets. however, the longer-term concern, according to jpmorgan, is that fewer people will need coinbase accounts, leading to pricing pressure. \"we see many novice investors never going beyond these flagship tokens and thus never needing the services of a coinbase,\" wrote the analysts, who have a neutral rating on the stock and an $80 price target. \"we also see the etf markets as more transparent, efficient and lower cost to execute and we see the potential for a migration to etfs for cheaper exposure and trading driving coinbase to lower fees.\" watch:  former sec enforcement chief on 'casualness' in crypto compliance"},

cybertruck at an \"unveiling\" event in 2019 and has since lamented about the \"unique complexities\" in making and bringing the sci-fi inspired vehicle to market. competing automakers including ford, general motors and rivian have all begun making and selling electric pickups since the cybertruck was first unveiled, beating tesla to the market. tesla ceo elon musk took the stage to reveal details about the company's new and unconventional cybertruck pickup on thursday in austin, texas, one day after he appeared in a bizarre interview at the dealbook summit in new york. at that earlier event, musk boasted, \"it will be the biggest product launch of anything by far on earth this year.\" in a dimly lit event space at the company's headquarters,\u00a0elon musk hyped up the fans in attendance saying, \"what we have here is a better truck than a truck, while also being a better sports car than a sports car in the same package.\" musk said the cybertruck's hard steel body was bulletproof, and that its windows were \"rock proof.\" he said it could tow over 11,000 pounds, accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.6 seconds and features a \"super-tough\" composite bed that is six feet long and four feet wide. he added that the vehicle would \"change the look of the roads\" and that the \"future finally looks like the future.\" the tesla ceo did not directly mention the pricing and battery range for the cybertruck. tesla's website would reveal that the rear-wheel drive base model for the cybertruck is now priced some 50% higher than the $40,000 the company originally aimed for before any tax breaks or other incentives. he then presented several \"production cybertrucks\" to beaming customers who drove away in them. in an october earnings call, musk struck a more cautious note saying, \"there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the cybertruck, and then in making the cybertruck cashflow positive.\" he also said at that time, \"we dug our own grave with cybertruck,\" pointing out \"unique challenges\" in producing and bringing that truck to market. according to tesla's website , the company will sell its base model rear-wheel drive version of the cybertruck for an estimated $60,990 and a \"cyberbeast\" version for $99,990, with the all-wheel drive version priced at $79,900. deliveries to customers will start for the all-wheel drive version and cyberbeast in 2024, the site says, and for the base model in 2025. the base model rear-wheel drive cybertruck is expected to have a 250 mile range battery and accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 6.5 seconds, and the all-wheel drive cybertruck is expected to have a range of 340 miles and go 0 to 60 miles per hour in 4.1 seconds with a top speed of 112 miles per hour. the highest-end cyberbeast would have the fastest acceleration and a range of 320 miles, estimated, with a top speed of 130 miles per hour. tesla first unveiled the cybertruck \u2014 with its angular and unpainted hard steel body \u2014 in november 2019 . it had previously said production of the vehicle would start in 2021, and the truck would sell at the entry-level price of $39,900 for a rear-wheel drive version, and around $69,000 for a highest-spec, tri-motor version, which is far more affordable than the prices tesla listed thursday. the company began taking $100 refundable \"reservations\" for the cybertruck after it was unveiled, and the company said it received more than one million reservations since its debut. customers must now put down $250 to move ahead with a cybertruck order, per the tesla website. while tesla unveiled its cybertruck design in 2019, it only began early cybertruck production in july this year. meanwhile, competitors including ford , general motors and rivian began to sell their more utilitarian electric pickups. earlier this week, rivian, which only manufactures battery electric vehicles, similar to tesla, started to offer a leasing option for select models of its all-electric r1t pickup truck. the u.s. electric pickup truck market has not expanded as quickly as some thought when the cybertruck was initially revealed. several startups have either now brought vehicles to market or did with little success, such as lordstown motors. both gm and ford have announced plans to scale back, postpone or cancel ev products and investments, including some related to ev trucks. tesla shares closed lower thursday by about 2% and were flat after hours. \u2014 cnbc's mike wayland contributed to this report. correction: this story was updated

(34.77%,) taiwan (23.91%) and china including hong kong (22.24%) in nvidia's third-quarter sales rankings. \"i would highly think it's due to data centers as singapore has quite a lot of data centers and cloud service providers,\" maybank securities analyst jarick seet told cnbc. \"the chips could also be sent to singapore for final assembly with other products and then shipped out to other countries,\" said seet. they could also be used for artificial intelligence, computing and electric vehicles, he added. \"what's a tiny city-state doing with all those chips? building data centers, of course!,\" said sang shin, an ex-temasek and gic executive, in a linkedin post . he previously served as director of digital innovation at temasek and head of digital strategy and architecture at gic. \"because the nation is stable and secure, there is a lot of talent, the digital infrastructure is solid, and the government policies are conducive to digital and data services,\" said shin. the same sec filing revealed that 80% of nvidia's third-quarter sales came from the data center segment, while gaming, professional visualization, automotive and others make up the rest. \"cloud service providers drove roughly half of data center revenue, while consumer internet companies and enterprises comprised approximately the other half,\" said nvidia in the filing. nvidia did not break down its singapore revenue by business segment. \"regarding singapore, a certain consumer internet company purchased data center solutions in q3 to be stood up in singapore data centers. lastly, singapore is also a growing area of specialized csps standing up data centers in the region,\" citi analysts wrote in a nov. 27 report. in january 2022, singapore lifted a moratorium issued in 2019 that temporarily paused the release of land for data center use and sought to moderate the growth of\u00a0data centers. singapore subsequently awarded rights in july to equinix , microsoft , chinese data center\u00a0solutions provider gds and a tie-up\u00a0between airtrunk and bytedance to develop new data center projects in singapore. there were more than 70 operational data centers\u00a0in\u00a0singapore , as of january\u00a02022.\u00a0the city-state still accounts for 60% of southeast asia's total data center capacity. singapore emerged third globally and first in asia pacific in terms of data center market rankings, according to a report by cushman and wakefield. northern virginia and portland in the u.s. tied for first while hong kong comes in at fourth. \"demand for data centers in singapore will remain high with the rapid growth of digital apps, e-commerce, internet of things, artificial intelligence, crypto-trading, blockchain activities, online gaming, etc. the shift to hybrid working and business digitalization has also contributed to the demand for data center space,\" said international trade administration in a report ."},

chip industry, designing custom silicon for every new iphone and mac. cnbc got a rare, exclusive look inside the lab.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/01/how-apple-makes-its-own-chips-for-iphone-and-mac-edging-out-intel.html", "author": "katie tarasov", "body": "apple's soaring stock price over the past two decades has been driven by its iconic consumer devices. it started with the ipod and imac. then came the iphone and ipad. and more recently, the apple watch and airpods. but there's a lot more to the biggest u.s. company by market cap than just gadgets. at its silicon valley headquarters, in a non-descript room filled with a couple hundred buzzing machines and a handful of engineers in lab coats, apple is designing the custom chips that power its most popular products. apple first debuted homegrown semiconductors in the iphone 4 in 2010. as of this year, all  new  mac computers are powered by apple's own silicon , ending the company's 15-plus years of reliance on intel. \"one of the most, if not the most, profound change at apple, certainly in our products over the last 20 years, is how we now do so many of those technologies in-house,\" said john ternus, who runs hardware engineering at apple. \"and top of the list, of course, is our silicon.\" that change has also opened apple up to a new set of risks. its most advanced silicon is primarily manufactured by one vendor, taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company . meanwhile, smartphones are recovering from a deep sales slump , and competitors like microsoft are making big leaps in artificial intelligence . in november, cnbc visited apple's campus in cupertino, california, the first journalists allowed to film inside one of the company's chip labs. we got a rare chance to talk with the head of apple silicon, johny srouji, about the company's push into the complex business of custom semiconductor development, which is also being pursued by amazon , google , microsoft and tesla . \"we have thousands of engineers,\" srouji said. \"but if you look at the portfolio of chips we do: very lean, actually. very efficient.\" unlike traditional chipmakers, apple is not making silicon for other companies. \"because we're not really selling chips outside, we focus on the product,\" srouji said. \"that gives us freedom to optimize, and the scalable architecture lets us reuse pieces between different products.\" srouji came to apple in 2008 to lead a small team of 40 or 50 engineers designing custom chips for the iphone. a month after he joined, apple bought p.a. semiconductor, a 150-person startup, for $278 million. \"they're going to start doing their own chips: that was the immediate takeaway when they bought p.a. semi,\" said ben bajarin, ceo and principal analyst at creative strategies. with its \"inherent design focus,\" bajarin said, apple wants \"to control as much of the stack\" as possible. two years after the acquisition, apple launched its first custom chip, the a4 , in the iphone 4 and original ipad. \"we built what we call the unified memory architecture that is scalable across products,\" srouji said. \"we built an architecture that you start with the iphone, but then we scaled it to the ipad and then to the watch and eventually to the mac.\" apple's silicon team has grown to thousands of engineers working across labs all over the world, including in israel, germany, austria, the u.k. and japan. within the u.s., the company has facilities in silicon valley, san diego and austin, texas. the primary type of chip apple is developing is known as a system on a chip, or soc. that brings together the central processing unit (cpu), graphics processing unit (gpu) and other components, bajarin explained, adding that for apple there's also a neural processing unit (npu) \"that runs the neural engine.\" \"it is the silicon and all of the blocks that go on to that silicon,\" bajarin said. apple's first soc was the a series, which has advanced from the a4 in 2010 to the a17 pro announced in september of this year. it's the central processor in iphones, as well as some ipads, apple tvs and the homepod. apple's other major soc is the m series, first released in 2020, which now powers all new macs and more advanced ipads. that product is up to the m3 line. launched in 2015, the s series is a smaller system in package, or sip, for apple watch. h and w chips are used in airpods. u chips allow communication between apple devices. and the newest chip, the r1, is set to ship early next year in apple's vision pro headset . dedicated to processing input from the device's cameras, sensors and microphones, apple says it will stream images to the displays within 12 milliseconds. \"we get to design the chips ahead of time,\" srouji said. he added that his staffers work with ternus's team \"to exactly and precisely build chips that are going to be targeted for those products, and only for those products.\" the h2 inside the 2nd generation airpods pro, for instance, enables better noise cancellation. inside the new series 9 apple watch, the s9 allows for unusual capabilities like double tap . in iphones, the a11 bionic in 2017 had the first apple neural engine , a dedicated part of the soc for performing ai tasks totally on-device. the latest a17 pro announced in the iphone 15 pro and pro max in september enables major leaps in features like computational photography and advanced rendering for gaming. \"it was actually the biggest redesign in gpu architecture and apple silicon history,\" said kaiann drance, who leads marketing for the iphone. \"we have hardware accelerated ray tracing for the first time. and we have mesh shading acceleration, which allows game developers to create some really stunning visual effects.\" that's led to the development of iphone-native versions from ubisoft 's assassin's creed mirage, the division resurgence and capcom 's resident evil 4. apple says the a17 pro is the first 3-nanometer chip to ship at high volume. \"the reason we use 3-nanometer is it gives us the ability to pack more transistors in a given dimension. that is important for the product and much better power efficiency,\" srouji said. \"even though we're not a chip company, we are leading the industry for a reason.\" apple's leap to 3-nanometer continued with the m3 chips for mac computers, announced in october. apple says the m3 enables features like 22-hour battery life and, similar to the a17 pro, boosted graphics performance. \"it's early days,\" said ternus, who's been at apple for 22 years.\u00a0\"we have a lot of work to do, but i think there's so many macs now, pretty much all macs are capable of running triple-a titles, which is not what it was like five years ago.\" ternus said that when he started, \"the way we tended to make products is we were using technologies from other companies, and we were effectively building the product around that.\" despite a focus on beautiful design, \"they were constrained by what was available,\" he said. in a major shift for the semiconductor industry, apple turned away from using intel's pc processors in 2020, switching to its own m1 chip inside the macbook air and other macs. \"it was almost like the laws of physics had changed,\" ternus said. \"all of a sudden we could build a macbook air that's incredibly thin and light, has no fan, 18 hours of battery life, and outperformed the macbook pro that we had just been shipping.\" he said the newest macbook pro with apple's most advanced chip, the m3 max, \"is 11 times faster than the fastest intel macbook pro we were making. and we were shipping that just two years ago.\" intel processors are based on x86 architecture, the traditional choice for pc makers, with a lot of software developed for it. apple bases its processors on rival arm architecture, known for using less power and helping laptop batteries last longer. apple's m1 in 2020 was a proving point for arm-based processors in high-end computers, with other big names like qualcomm \u2014 and reportedly amd and nvidia \u2014 also developing arm-based pc processors. in september, apple extended its deal with arm through at least 2040. when its first custom chip came out 13 years ago, apple was unusual as a non-chip  company trying to make it in the cutthroat, cost-prohibitive semiconductor market. since then, amazon, google, microsoft and tesla have tried their hand at custom chips. \"apple was sort of the trailblazer,\" said stacy rasgon, managing director and senior analyst at bernstein research. \"they sort of showed that if you do this, you can have a stab at differentiating your products.\" apple isn't yet making every piece of silicon in its devices. modems, for example, are one big component the company has yet to conquer on its own. \"the processors have been remarkably good. where they've struggled is on the modem side, is on the radio side in the phones,\" rasgon said. \"modems are hard.\" apple relies on qualcomm for its modems, although in 2019, the two companies settled a two-year legal battle over intellectual property. soon after, apple bought the majority of intel's 5g modem business for $1 billion, in a likely move to develop its own cellular modem. that hasn't happened yet, and in september, apple signed on with qualcomm to supply its modems through 2026 . \"qualcomm still makes the best modems in the world,\" bajarin said. \"until apple can do as good of a job, i have a hard time seeing them fully jump to that.\" apple's srouji said he couldn't comment on \"future technologies and products\" but said \"we care about cellular, and we have teams enabling that.\" apple is also reportedly working on its own wi-fi and bluetooth chip. for now, it has a fresh multibillion-dollar deal with broadcom for wireless components. apple relies on third parties like samsung and micron for memory. \"our aspiration is the product,\" srouji said, when asked if apple will try to design every part of its chips. \"we want to build the best products on the planet. as a technology team, which also includes the chips in this case, we want to build the best technology that would enable that vision.\" to deliver on that objective, apple will \"buy off the shelf\" if it means the team can focus \"on what really, really matters,\" srouji said. regardless of how much silicon apple eventually designs, it still needs to manufacture  its chips externally. that requires massive fabrication plants owned by foundry companies like tsmc. more than 90% of the world's advanced chips are made by tsmc in taiwan, which leaves apple and the rest of the industry vulnerable to the china threat of invasion. \"there is obviously a lot of tension around, like, what would plan b be if that happened?\" bajarin said. \"there isn't another good option. you would hope that samsung is also competitive and intel wants to be there. but again, we're not right now. it's really all at tsmc.\" apple is at least looking to bring some of that manufacturing to the u.s. it's committed to becoming the largest customer at tsmc's coming fab in arizona. and on thursday apple announced it will be the first and largest customer of the new $2 billion amkor manufacturing and packaging facility being built in peoria, arizona. amkor will package apple silicon produced at tsmc's arizona fab. \"we always want to have a diversified supply: asia, europe and the u.s., which is why i think tsmc building fabs in arizona is great,\" srouji said. another concern is the shortage of skilled chip labor in the u.s., where advanced fabs haven't been built for decades. tsmc says its arizona fab is now delayed to 2025 because of a lack of skilled workers. whether or not it has to do with a shortage of talent, apple has seen a slowdown in the release of new chips. \"generations are taking longer because they are getting harder and harder,\" srouji said. \"and the ability to pack more and get power efficiency is also different than 10 years ago.\" srouji reiterated his view that apple has an advantage in that regard because \"i don't need to worry about where do i send my chips, how do i target a larger customer base?\" still, apple's actions underscore the competitiveness in the market. in 2019, apple chip architect gerard williams left to lead a data center chip startup called nuvia, bringing some apple engineers with him. apple sued williams over ip concerns, before dropping the case this year. qualcomm bought nuvia in 2021, in a move to compete in arm-based pc processors like apple's. \"i can't really discuss legal matters, but we truly care about ip protection,\" srouji said. \"when certain people leave for certain reasons, that's their choice.\" apple has additional macro challenges in its core business because smartphone sales are just recovering from their lowest levels in years. however, demand for ai workloads is leading to a surge in orders for silicon, especially for gpus made by companies like nvidia , whose stock has jumped more than 200% this year tied to the popularity of chatgpt and other generative ai services. google has designed a tensor processing unit for ai since 2016.\u00a0amazon web services has had its own ai chips for the data center since 2018. microsoft released its new ai chip in november. srouji said his team at apple has been working on its machine learning engines, the apple neural engine, since years before it was launched in the a11 bionic chip in 2017. he also pointed to embedded machine learning accelerators in its cpu and \"highly optimized gpu for machine learning.\" apple's neural engines power what it calls \" on-device machine learning features \" like face id and animojis. in july, bloomberg reported that apple built its own large language model called ajax and a chatbot called apple gpt. a spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the accuracy of the report. apple has also acquired more than two dozen ai companies since 2015. when asked if apple appears to be falling behind in ai, srouji said, \"i don't believe we are.\" bajarin is more skeptical. \"it's doable on apple's last year chip, even more capable on this year's chip with m3,\" bajarin said, regarding apple's position in ai. \"but the software has got to catch up with that, so that developers take advantage and write tomorrow's ai software on apple silicon.\" he anticipates improvements, and soon. \"apple had an opportunity to really get on that from day one,\" bajarin said. \"but i think everyone expects it's coming in the coming year.\" watch the video to learn more."},
