the movies are exceptional comic book stories, but the thing that puts the miles morales-led films' head and shoulders above most other superhero flicks is the unique artwork and visual style. marvel's official art book for the most recent installment makes a great gift for any webhead fans you know, or really anyone who appreciates a good hardcover. although console makers sell controllers in a fun range of colors, gifting a custom gamepad goes above and beyond to create something truly unique. microsoft offers its xbox design lab for customizing its standard and elite controllers, while third-party boutique shops like battle beaver and aimcontrollers offer a dizzying array of cosmetic and esports-focused hardware mods for both playstation and xbox pads. is one of the best crpgs of all time, whether you\u2019re a hardcore pencil-and-paper rpg veteran or a complete newcomer. the turn-based combat is exceptional, but the character interaction and roleplaying is its true hallmark. the branching paths of the story offer hundreds of hours of playtime, with exceptional voice acting that makes the characters both memorable and endearing. while some criticize that the standard xbox wireless controller ships with basic aa batteries, one advantage is that you can easily replace them with good old-fashioned rechargeable cells. hori\u2019s dual charging cradle comes with two long-lasting rechargeable batteries and four replacement battery covers, so you simply drop a controller or two down to immediately begin charging. if you subscribe to apple arcade, an apple tv 4k can effectively double as both a mini gaming console and one of the best streaming devices you can buy. with it, you can connect a bluetooth controller like the playstation 5\u2019s dualsense, thus allowing games that were initially developed for pc / consoles to be played on the big screen for which they were designed. the second-gen sonos beam is a terrific sound bar with big sound for its small footprint. it uses earc for minimal latency, so playing games doesn\u2019t have that annoying audio delay that can plague entry-level home theater setups. plus, it integrates with the rest of sonos' wi-fi-connected ecosystem if you choose to expand your music listening to multiple rooms. \u201chey-a there, boy-o!\u201d it\u2019s a plush version of skelly, the lovable scamp and bone-a-fide buddy / test dummy from supergiant games\u2019 . the trash-talking plush features poseable arms and legs, and he sounds off with various one-liners when you rough him up or squeeze him. just keep in mind that plush skelly won\u2019t magically re-form when cut into pieces like his in-game version. if you\u2019re a fan of both fromsoftware and records, the elden ring standard edition vinyl from bandai namco is a treat to own. the moody instrumental soundtrack collects 17 tracks on two marbled, smoke-gray lps for over one hour of music from the lands between, complete with some lovely artwork of the game\u2019s iconic erdtree on the inner gatefold. mcu movie fatigue may be a very real thing for many of us, but remains a high point for the marvel cinematic universe. the six-episode disney plus series, which stars tom hiddleston as the titular antihero, is quite different from the usual superhero formula thanks to its unique set design and characters \u2014 not to mention its fun time paradoxes. is the perfect ice breaker for a group of up to six people. the deduction-based card game is a great on-ramp to more involved and unique \u201cdesigner\u201d tabletop games, though it\u2019s so much fun on its own that i wouldn't be particularly shocked if you ended up playing this inexpensive, travel-friendly game all night. got a tv that\u2019s limited to a single hdmi 2.1 port, thus hampering your ability to get the most out of current consoles? a two-by-one splitter like this option from jsaux allows both a playstation 5 and an xbox series x to share the same port, so both consoles can reach 4k resolution / 120hz on supported sets. a date night spent indoors isn\u2019t complete without a little friendly competition, and hounded is a fantastic way to test your cunning against one another. one player plays as the fox, trying to outsmart and outrun the other player\u2019s master of hounds. it\u2019s a simple strategy game that takes less than one hour, lending itself well to lots of rematches. fans who thoroughly enjoyed the animated series on disney plus are likely to dig . emma mieko candon's original book is inspired by \"the duel,\" a short that blends with feudal japan as it recounts the tale of a wandering sith who struggles to escape his past. the nerf lmtd halo needler is part foam dart blaster, part trophy piece. it's a faithful recreation of the iconic needler from the halo franchise, complete with light-up needles. it looks great on a shelf, but, being nerf, you can also use its motorized drum to rattle off up to 10 darts when it's time to have some fun. it\u2019s best used at any grunt birthday parties (wink-wink). casetify\u2019s line of phone cases, airpod cases, and other accessories are sure to be a hit with fans of the classic mecha anime. many of the designs prominently feature the iconic characters and eva units of the show and rebuild movies, including some of that classic nerv and seele typography. many of the best tvs for gaming right now are super-pricey oleds, but the tcl qm8 is a 4k panel that offers a lot at a much lower price tag. the mini led tv offers fantastic brightness, great black levels, and natively supports a 120hz refresh rate via a pair of two hdmi 2.1 ports, which is just enough for connecting both a ps5 and xbox series x. gifting someone a few months of xbox game pass grants them access to hundreds of quality titles for xbox series x / s consoles \u2014 including , the latest , and some of the biggest games of the year. there are also surprise hits like and indie works of art like , making it quite the curated collection of games. few gaming laptops are as svelte and enjoyable to use for actual laptop duties as the asus rog zephyrus g14. the excellent 14-incher can handle high-fidelity games on its 165hz qhd screen, but unlike other gaming laptops, it\u2019s actually designed to leave your desk and do the everyday computing thing \u2014 without leaving you feeling like you\u2019re toting around a boat anchor everywhere you go. the xbox 360 was a hallmark console that ushered in a new era of hd graphics and online play. now, you can enshrine your fondness for the 18-year-old console with this building set by mega. the 1,342-piece model recreates the uniquely shaped console itself, its wireless gamepad, and even the physical case for . meta\u2019s quest 3 makes big strides in the comfort and performance departments, with much-improved displays and snappier performance than the quest 2. it\u2019s the best standalone vr headset you can buy for someone right now, and it\u2019s capable of playing fitness games like as well as aaa vr experiences like and the upcoming . hero forge makes 3d-printed miniatures for tabletop role-playing games, which you custom design using a video game-like character creator. you can tweak the species, stature, hair, clothing, and armaments of your character, while picking from either plastic or metal designs. and for those with 3d printers and a little know-how, you can opt for an stl file to print your own. \u201cwhat was that noise?!\u201d this inspired tote is sure to help you on your solo infiltration missions, even if they have you going no further than your local bodega. the spacious canvas bag is ideal for carrying small fruits and fresh vegetables, as well as fooling nearby enemies. they say don\u2019t deal with the devil but you definitely should deal with this adorable marionette. the titular character looks adorable as a poseable, functioning puppet, which also happens to come with a working music box. just like in the game, you can navigate cuphead through some adventures, hear those vintage-sounding tunes, and probably die. like, a lot. the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"},

(gemini ultra is coming next year.) developers and enterprise customers will be able to access gemini pro through google generative ai studio or vertex ai in google cloud starting on december 13th. gemini is only available in english for now, with other languages evidently coming soon. but pichai says the model will eventually be integrated into , its ad products, the chrome browser, and more, all over the world. it is the future of google, and it\u2019s here not a moment too soon. openai launched chatgpt , and the company and product immediately became the biggest things in ai. now, google \u2014\u00a0the company that created behind the current ai boom, that has called itself an \u201cai-first\u201d organization for nearly a decade, and that was clearly and embarrassingly caught off guard by how good chatgpt was and how fast openai\u2019s tech has taken over the industry \u2014 is finally ready to fight back. so, let\u2019s just get to the important question, shall we? openai\u2019s gpt-4 versus google\u2019s gemini: ready, go. this has very clearly been on google\u2019s mind for a while. \u201cwe\u2019ve done a very thorough analysis of the systems side by side, and the benchmarking,\u201d hassabis says. google ran 32 well-established benchmarks comparing the two models, from broad overall tests like the multi-task language understanding benchmark to one that compares two models\u2019 ability to generate python code. \u201ci think we\u2019re substantially ahead on 30 out of 32\u201d of those benchmarks, hassabis says, with a bit of a smile on his face. \u201csome of them are very narrow. some of them are larger.\u201d google says gemini beats gpt-4 in 30 out of 32 benchmarks in those benchmarks (which really are mostly very close) gemini\u2019s clearest advantage comes from its ability to understand and interact with video and audio. this is very much by design: multimodality has been part of the gemini plan from the beginning. google hasn\u2019t trained separate models for images and voice, the way openai created and ; it built one multisensory model from the beginning. \u201cwe\u2019ve always been interested in very, very general systems,\u201d hassabis says. he\u2019s especially interested in how to mix all of those modes \u2014 to collect as much data as possible from any number of inputs and senses and then give responses with just as much variety. right now, gemini\u2019s most basic models are text in and text out, but more powerful models like gemini ultra can work with images, video, and audio. and \u201cit\u2019s going to get even more general than that,\u201d hassabis says. \u201cthere\u2019s still things like action, and touch \u2014 more like robotics-type things.\u201d over time, he says, gemini will get more senses, become more aware, and become more accurate and grounded in the process. \u201cthese models just sort of understand better about the world around them.\u201d\u00a0these models still hallucinate, of course, and they still have biases and other problems. but the more they know, hassabis says, the better they\u2019ll get. \u201cthese models just sort of understand better about the world around them.\u201d benchmarks are just benchmarks, though, and ultimately, the true test of gemini\u2019s capability will come from everyday users who want to use it to brainstorm ideas, look up information, write code, and much more. google seems to see coding in particular as a killer app for gemini; it uses a new code-generating system called alphacode 2 that it says performs better than 85 percent of coding competition participants, up from 50 percent for the original alphacode. but pichai says that users will notice an improvement in just about everything the model touches. equally important to google is that gemini is apparently a far more efficient model. it was trained on google\u2019s own tensor processing units and is both faster and cheaper to run than google\u2019s previous models like palm. alongside the new model, google is also launching a new version of its tpu system, the tpu v5p, a computing system designed for use in data centers for training and running large-scale models. talking to pichai and hassabis, it\u2019s clear that they see the gemini launch both as the beginning of a larger project and as a step change in itself. gemini is the model google has been waiting for, the one it has been building toward for years, maybe even the one it should have had ready before openai and chatgpt took over the world. google, which declared a \u201c \u201d after chatgpt\u2019s launch and has been perceived to be playing catch-up ever since, seems to be still trying to hold fast to its \u201cbold and responsible\u201d mantra. hassabis and pichai both say they\u2019re not willing to move too fast just to keep up, especially as we get closer to the ultimate ai dream: artificial general intelligence, the term for an ai that is self-improving, smarter than humans, and poised to change the world. \u201cas we approach agi, things are going to be different,\u201d hassabis says. \u201cit\u2019s kind of an active technology, so i think we have to approach that cautiously. cautiously, but optimistically.\u201d google says it has worked hard to ensure gemini\u2019s safety and responsibility, both through internal and external testing and red-teaming. pichai points out that ensuring data security and reliability is particularly important for enterprise-first products, which is where most generative ai makes its money. but hassabis acknowledges that one of the risks of launching a state-of-the-art ai system is that it will have issues and attack vectors no one could have predicted. \u201cthat\u2019s why you have to release things,\u201d he says, \u201cto see and learn.\u201d google is taking the ultra release particularly slowly; hassabis compares it to a controlled beta, with a \u201csafer experimentation zone\u201d for google\u2019s most capable and unrestrained model. basically, if there\u2019s a marriage-ruining alternate personality inside gemini, google is trying to find it before you do. for years, pichai and other google executives have waxed poetic about the potential for ai. pichai himself has said more than once that ai will be more transformative to humanity than fire or electricity. in this first generation, the gemini model may not change the world. best-case scenario, it might just help google catch up to openai in the race to build great generative ai. (worst-case scenario, bard stays boring and mediocre, and chatgpt keeps winning.) but pichai, hassabis, and everyone else at google seem to think this is the beginning of something truly huge. the web made google a tech giant; gemini could be even bigger. / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"},
