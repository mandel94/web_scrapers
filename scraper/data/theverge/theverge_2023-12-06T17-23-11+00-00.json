(gemini ultra is coming next year.) developers and enterprise customers will be able to access gemini pro through google generative ai studio or vertex ai in google cloud starting on december 13th. gemini is only available in english for now, with other languages evidently coming soon. but pichai says the model will eventually be integrated into , its ad products, the chrome browser, and more, all over the world. it is the future of google, and it\u2019s here not a moment too soon. openai launched chatgpt , and the company and product immediately became the biggest things in ai. now, google \u2014\u00a0the company that created behind the current ai boom, that has called itself an \u201cai-first\u201d organization for nearly a decade, and that was clearly and embarrassingly caught off guard by how good chatgpt was and how fast openai\u2019s tech has taken over the industry \u2014 is finally ready to fight back. so, let\u2019s just get to the important question, shall we? openai\u2019s gpt-4 versus google\u2019s gemini: ready, go. this has very clearly been on google\u2019s mind for a while. \u201cwe\u2019ve done a very thorough analysis of the systems side by side, and the benchmarking,\u201d hassabis says. google ran 32 well-established benchmarks comparing the two models, from broad overall tests like the multi-task language understanding benchmark to one that compares two models\u2019 ability to generate python code. \u201ci think we\u2019re substantially ahead on 30 out of 32\u201d of those benchmarks, hassabis says, with a bit of a smile on his face. \u201csome of them are very narrow. some of them are larger.\u201d google says gemini beats gpt-4 in 30 out of 32 benchmarks in those benchmarks (which really are mostly very close) gemini\u2019s clearest advantage comes from its ability to understand and interact with video and audio. this is very much by design: multimodality has been part of the gemini plan from the beginning. google hasn\u2019t trained separate models for images and voice, the way openai created and ; it built one multisensory model from the beginning. \u201cwe\u2019ve always been interested in very, very general systems,\u201d hassabis says. he\u2019s especially interested in how to mix all of those modes \u2014 to collect as much data as possible from any number of inputs and senses and then give responses with just as much variety. right now, gemini\u2019s most basic models are text in and text out, but more powerful models like gemini ultra can work with images, video, and audio. and \u201cit\u2019s going to get even more general than that,\u201d hassabis says. \u201cthere\u2019s still things like action, and touch \u2014 more like robotics-type things.\u201d over time, he says, gemini will get more senses, become more aware, and become more accurate and grounded in the process. \u201cthese models just sort of understand better about the world around them.\u201d\u00a0these models still hallucinate, of course, and they still have biases and other problems. but the more they know, hassabis says, the better they\u2019ll get. \u201cthese models just sort of understand better about the world around them.\u201d benchmarks are just benchmarks, though, and ultimately, the true test of gemini\u2019s capability will come from everyday users who want to use it to brainstorm ideas, look up information, write code, and much more. google seems to see coding in particular as a killer app for gemini; it uses a new code-generating system called alphacode 2 that it says performs better than 85 percent of coding competition participants, up from 50 percent for the original alphacode. but pichai says that users will notice an improvement in just about everything the model touches. equally important to google is that gemini is apparently a far more efficient model. it was trained on google\u2019s own tensor processing units and is both faster and cheaper to run than google\u2019s previous models like palm. alongside the new model, google is also launching a new version of its tpu system, the tpu v5p, a computing system designed for use in data centers for training and running large-scale models. talking to pichai and hassabis, it\u2019s clear that they see the gemini launch both as the beginning of a larger project and as a step change in itself. gemini is the model google has been waiting for, the one it has been building toward for years, maybe even the one it should have had ready before openai and chatgpt took over the world. google, which declared a \u201c \u201d after chatgpt\u2019s launch and has been perceived to be playing catch-up ever since, seems to be still trying to hold fast to its \u201cbold and responsible\u201d mantra. hassabis and pichai both say they\u2019re not willing to move too fast just to keep up, especially as we get closer to the ultimate ai dream: artificial general intelligence, the term for an ai that is self-improving, smarter than humans, and poised to change the world. \u201cas we approach agi, things are going to be different,\u201d hassabis says. \u201cit\u2019s kind of an active technology, so i think we have to approach that cautiously. cautiously, but optimistically.\u201d google says it has worked hard to ensure gemini\u2019s safety and responsibility, both through internal and external testing and red-teaming. pichai points out that ensuring data security and reliability is particularly important for enterprise-first products, which is where most generative ai makes its money. but hassabis acknowledges that one of the risks of launching a state-of-the-art ai system is that it will have issues and attack vectors no one could have predicted. \u201cthat\u2019s why you have to release things,\u201d he says, \u201cto see and learn.\u201d google is taking the ultra release particularly slowly; hassabis compares it to a controlled beta, with a \u201csafer experimentation zone\u201d for google\u2019s most capable and unrestrained model. basically, if there\u2019s a marriage-ruining alternate personality inside gemini, google is trying to find it before you do. for years, pichai and other google executives have waxed poetic about the potential for ai. pichai himself has said more than once that ai will be more transformative to humanity than fire or electricity. in this first generation, the gemini model may not change the world. best-case scenario, it might just help google catch up to openai in the race to build great generative ai. (worst-case scenario, bard stays boring and mediocre, and chatgpt keeps winning.) but pichai, hassabis, and everyone else at google seem to think this is the beginning of something truly huge. the web made google a tech giant; gemini could be even bigger. / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"},

google says that recent pixel phones (the pixel 6 and newer) can now be used as usb webcams on computers that support uvc (usb video class). and if you\u2019re trying to wrangle and organize your receipts, you\u2019ll likely appreciate a new \u201cclean\u201d option that can rid them of smudges, stains, and creases before you attach them to your expense reports. yep, there\u2019s more. pixel devices now include a repair mode that will safeguard your private data when your phone is in for servicing. this will keep your photos, messages, and other sensitive content away from anyone conducting the repair work. on the subject of security, google\u2019s password manager \u201ccan identify which of your accounts support passkeys and help you add them with just a few taps.\u201d if you\u2019ve bought into the pixel ecosystem and are sporting a pixel watch or pixel watch 2 on your wrist, google\u2019s wearable can now automatically unlock your phone. that\u2019s ever so slightly faster and more convenient than relying on face unlock or google\u2019s sometimes inconsistent fingerprint readers to bypass your lock screen. also, call screen will now appear on the pixel watch, so you can dismiss or pick up a call from your wrist as you watch the live voicemail transcription. and for owners of the pixel tablet, google is adding spatial audio \u2014 both via its built-in speakers and through the pixel buds pro \u2014 and clear calling with the december update. to read the full rundown, including a new combined clock / weather widget, new watchfaces for the original pixel watch, and more, check out google\u2019s blog post. the december update . it\u2019s encouraging to see google wrapping up 2023 by bringing even more synergy and cohesion to its product portfolio. and don\u2019t forget that, as of the time of this writing, the pixel 8 and 8 pro are still on sale at prices that match their black friday discounts. / the verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023  , llc. all rights reserved"},
